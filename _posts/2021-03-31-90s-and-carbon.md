### The mission of 90s

If people of different ages are marked with carbon emission intensity, the 90s generation will be the 'carbon peak generation' on average, which is the generation with the largest per capita carbon emission in human history (except in US). **So, who should be responsible for their behaviors? Themselves.**

And if they are lucky enough, they will witness the arrival of carbon zero, the turning point once in history. From 2020 to 2060, the research, the development, the popularization of key technologies of green energy transit will most likely be contributed by the 90s generation. This is the mission of this generation.

- Why not 80s? Most of 80s will only work before the coming of carbon neutral by 2050/2060, which is exactly when the 90s is going to retire.
- If we cannot make progress in reducing emissions to 'zero' by 2050/2060 ( the Paris Climate Agreement will fail as well) , then, the problems will be left to the future generations, **just like American born in the 60s did**.🤷‍♂️
