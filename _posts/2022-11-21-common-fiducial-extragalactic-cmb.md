In this document we plan do describe a set of fiducial sky models that can be used for simulation purposes by all Cosmic Microwave Background experiments to simplify the work of comparing their performance and perform joint analysis.

For [this other page for Galactic foregrounds](https://galsci.github.io/blog/2022/common-fiducial-sky/)

## Extragalactic Foregrounds

Extragalactic maps are based on [Websky 0.4](https://mocks.cita.utoronto.ca/index.php/WebSky_Extragalactic_CMB_Mocks) simulations. They are implemented in PySM `3.4.0b5`.

* CIB: Interpolated from maps generated by the model at $$N_{side}=4096$$
* tSZ, kSZ: Thermal and Kinetic SZ maps at $$N_{side}=4096$$
* radio galaxies: they are provided by the Websky team as input templates at different frequencies to be interpolated over, they are provided as point sources, therefore they give some residual errors in Spherical Harmonics Transforms, but the result look reasonable if compared to Planck 30GHz and Planck 353GHz.

## Cosmic Microwave Background

Using the same cosmological parameters of Websky for compatibility with the Extragalactic components:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    & \Omega_b = 0.049 \\
    & \Omega_c = 0.261 \\
    & \Omega_m = \Omega_b + \Omega_c \\
    & h = 0.68 \\
    & n_s = 0.965 \\
    & A_s = 2.022 e^{-9} \\
    & N_{eff} = 3.046 \\
    & \tau = 0.055
    \end{aligned}
$$

Lensed with the potential estimated by Websky.
Produce Lensed and Unlensed CMB sky scalar only, and then a separate tensor component with the adequate value of $$r$$ and tensor spectral index ($$n_t$$) equal to 0.
