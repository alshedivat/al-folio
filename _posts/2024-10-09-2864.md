Team members consisted of Ranga Chandrasekaran, Runa Bhaumik, Tommy Cheng, Andrew Wentzel, Nafiul Nipu, Hossein Fathollahian, and Sanjana Srabanti.<br><br>
The problem they tackled was:<br>
The mental health symptoms/diseases in cancer patients are often not recognized and managed.  Compare the prevalence of mental health disorders in different cancers.<br><br>
The Institute for Equitable Health Data Science Research&rsquo;s mission is to analyze and eliminate potential biases before they are unwittingly embedded in artificial intelligence algorithms in healthcare. In particular, the institute, with its fabric of interdisciplinary collaborations, will shape solutions for biomedical and health data science and technology while prioritizing health equity for Chicago&rsquo;s diverse population and beyond.  The institute is co-directed by Prof. Andrew Boyd and Prof. Elisabeta (Liz) Marai.
