description: An introduction and resources for understanding programming languages.

Studying the theoretical aspects of programming languages for the first time can be a little
daunting; The semantics, the syntax and the dreaded types. The more papers I delved into, the
more confused I was becoming. Some call it sugar, some scopes, agents etc. The trick here is not
to get too overwhelmed and start from level 0.00. From my experience, I started exploring the
theoretical world of PL from Jan'19. Based on that, I have had my own shares of ups and downs.

However, based on my short experience and still ongoing experience, I will update the Resources
and the material I used along the way to get a deeper understanding.

1. The first book I would suggest would be ["The semantics of Programming Languages" ](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Matthew.Hennessy/splexternal2015/LectureNotes/Notes14%20copy.pdf) by Matthew Hennessy.


2. The other really great collection of material can be found on [this](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Matthew.Hennessy/splexternal2015/reading.php) link. I have a lot of catching up to do and I am trying to do so slowly.
