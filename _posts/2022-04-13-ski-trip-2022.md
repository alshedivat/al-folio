##### How's your winter?

So many friends asked me the question about my first Norwegian winter. Was it too dim, too cold, too lonely?

##### Short answer

Yes, but it's damn good. I love it so much and am almost addicted to winter sports, even though this is my first snow season.



### Nordmarka - 57 km cross-country

<center>Grua to Sognsvann </center>

12 Feb 2022 a 57-kilometer long distance xc skiing from Grua to Sognsvann started. I joined, despite having just one month of snow experience. 

It was petty late when we reached sognsvann where the icy condition was not good for classical xc movement but easy for skating. So I was suggested and taught how to skate skiing. I wanna say thanks to Gert and Lidia.

### Høgevarde, Norefjell - Cabin trip

I was able to skate skiing a few weeks later on my trip to Norefjell. I went with Gert and Lidia again. And our original plan was a top tour to Høgevarde (1459). But the cabin were closed so we took nearby Gråfjell (1466) instead with xc skis.

The DNT cabin built in 1986 was old-fashion, but a warm place to stay. We melted snow to get water, and cook. We sat around the table, Oliveria read the guest book of decades years ago, Hanna knit sweaters, Vera filled out the word puzzle...

I was so happy with my lovely tourmates, that I purposed a after party when we came back to Oslo.

After that, I quickly brought fjellski because I realized that xc skis is not enough for enjoying the mountains.

### Finse - Field trip 1

This is not a ski trip but rather a fieldwork. The elevation from LiDAR sensor was used to compared with ICESat-2 when the satellite passed over the same track.



### Finse - Field trip 2

I miss my class trip to Finse, where we learned about snow profiles, snowpack instability tests, flux towers, and avalanche beacons. This is an excellent tutorials of avalanche awareness, particularly for winter activities fans.

After class, the lecturer did some slopes with us. I found it would be fun to learn telemark skiing, albeit  today there are not much local telemark skiers in Norway ([Telemark skiing is dead](https://trewgear.com/blogs/happenings/why-i-stille-telly-the-art-of-telemark-skiing) ).



### Snøhetta, Dovrefjell  - Cabin trip

During Easter, I went to Dovrefjell with Kristian, Einar and Vemund. Damn, this is a amazing trip. We took the Snøhetta (2286) but we missed snow cave (too tired) and muskox (unlucky). When we went down from slope, my balance on skis was pretty good, behaving like a pro, I was told.

In 3 days mountain trips without electricity and network, I enjoyed the peace, the quiet, and the real connection with people, instead of a feeling of emptiness by social media. 

Hope we meet again.
