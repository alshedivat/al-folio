### What is PPSB?

PPSB is an open-sourced Privacy-Preserving Safe Browsing platform. It enables the Safe Browsing service without sacrificing your privacy. Particularly, in PPSB, the actual URL to be checked, as well as its associated hashes or hash prefixes, never leave your browser in cleartext.

Prior work, including Microsoft Safe Browsing and Google Safe Browsing, has shown that the data sent to the server may either expose URLs directly to the service or allow inference of URLs. Our paper proposes a method for performing safe browsing that shields URLs that the user attempts to visit from the safe browsing service.Â
