Moin Moin,

Jan Lehnardt sent a link to the CouchDB [marketing@couchdb.apache.org](http://couchdb.apache.org/#marketing-mailing-list) mailing list where [Ari Najarian](https://twitter.com/stickbyatlas) used CouchDB in a [five part course to teach beginners how to program](http://www.torusoft.com/blog/5-days-of-code-curriculum-day-3). It's a great read and I invite you to visit the page.

I would like to slice out one quote from the article where Ari described the CouchDB community:

*"The personalities and voices in the CouchDB community are, hands down, the most helpful, generous, welcoming, insightful, ethical, principled, future-minded group of developers I've ever encountered in one place. As far as online communities go, you can't find a safer, more encouraging group of advocates. These people are role models that will help beginners to understand what "open-source" can really be about: social justice, diversity, inclusion, and collaboration."*

This is the reason why I became a part of the Apache CouchDB project - because the community is so awesome.

Cheers

Andy
