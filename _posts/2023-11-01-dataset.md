What is the difference between DTM1, DTM10, Copernicus GLO30, and FABDEM? How do they compare with ICESat-2? On Zenodo, I uploaded a dataset (10.5281/zenodo.10048875) to answer these questions.

The first step to compare different elevation products is co-registration. Here, I used the Gradient Descent Co-registration method that I mentioned in a previous post.

#### The Performance of Co-registration

After co‑registration, the percentage of points with a deviation less than 0.5 m from ICESat‑2 snow‑free segments is calculated to be 48.9%, 49.13%, 23.7%, and 27.2% for DTM1, DTM10, GLO30, and FABDEM respectively. In terms of NMAD (Normalized Median Absolute Deviation), for example, the improvement for DTM10 is from 0.99m to 0.77m (NMAD). If we attribute the residual bias partially to ICESat-2, we can use the subset_te_flag to exclude bad segments. This will result in better metrics for the co-registered DEM (Table 4.2 in my thesis).

<div class="caption"> Figure 1.: Statistic Binning Analysis: Co-registration and Bias Correction (ICESat-2 - DTM10). The dataset was divided into categories at three stages, and for each category, a violin plot displays the distribution of data. The median of each dataset is represented by a white dot at the center of the violin. The thick bar illustrates the 25% and 75% quantiles, respectively. If the violin is skewed to one side, it indicates a deviation from normal distribution. The aspect-dependent bias is identified and eliminated by co-registration (a); The negative bias is widespread after co-registration (a, b, c).

$$dh = IS2_{snow-free} - DEM $$


From figure 1, we can clearly see the aspect-dependent error, the fingerprint of the geo-referencing mismatch, is removed through co-registration, as indicated by the median value (Q50) being located close to zero for all bins (a). Although ATL08 (version 5) has contained geolocation errors since 2021.12 (which have been fixed in version 6), the overall amount of data from that period is not significant to produce wrong co-registration. Additionally, gradient descent co-registration has a certain ability to suppress noise.

The figure also shows significant residual bias after co-registration. The dh has a nearly linear relationship with slope and curvature (b, c). This bias requires further correction.

### The Difference after Bias Correction

After the bias correction, the comparison between DTM1 and DTM10 indicates that they both achieved a high level of accuracy on low slope categories, with less than 1 m and 0.5 m NMAD in 65% and 35% of cases, respectively. In contrast, the worst results are observed in the top 5% of *slope* quantiles and the least 5% of *n_photons* quantiles, which resulted in an NMAD of 2.4 m and 1.8 m, respectively. The bias correction applied to GLO30 produced better results than for FAB, with approximately 40% of measurements showing an NMAD of less than 1 m on the low slopes category (Figure 4.3 in my thesis). These improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in eliminating biases.

<div class="caption"> Figure 2.: The Overall Distribution of DEM errors. DTM10 (upper left), DTM1 (upper right), COP30 (lower left), FAB (lower right). The statistical data for raw, after co-registration, and bias-correction are represented by blue, black, and red colors respectively. The 25% quantile (Q1) and the 75% quantile (Q3) are displayed from left to right along the x-axis. After bias correction, Q1 has moved closer to the median, indicating a reduction in negative skewness. Please note that a window of -10 m to 10 m was used to filter outliers in the metrics employed. And, the number of measurements is given by n (DEM) and N (total).
</div>

Figure 2 shows the overall $dh$ distributions, which exhibit a negative skewness with long tails on the left side. Prior to bias correction, GLO30 had a median of -1.30 m, while FAB, which is a version of GLO30 with vegetation and building removed, exhibited less skewness. Although DTM1 and DTM10 had similar shapes, their 25% quantiles (Q1) suggested the presence of systematic biases. After implementing the bias correction, there was a noticeable enhancement in the overall symmetry observed across all four scenarios. This was supported by the fact that Q1 moved nearer to the median, while Q3 remained relatively stable. Ultimately, there is an overall NMAD of 0.56 m and 0.57 m for DTM10 and DTM1, respectively. GLO30 and FAB had higher NMAD of 0.98 m and 1.08 m. It is evident that bias correction led to a significant improvement in the accuracy of the results.

One meter of NMAD -- This might be the highest precision that could be achieved for Copernicus GLO30 and FAB. On the other hand, we noticed negative skewness exhibited on all DEMs for unknown reason.

#### Negative Skewness of ICESat-2

The negative values have a spatial distribution pattern, which is widely spread on convex terrain. The figure below plots nine curvature combinations categorized by profile curvature and plan curvature. The aggregated mean value of elevation differences reveals that convex ridged terrain (positive plan curvature and negative profile curvature) typically exhibits negative skewness (a,g). A concave bowl-shaped terrain with negative profile curvature does not have much negative skewness, even at high slopes (b), thereby indicating that the observed linear relationship between bias and slope is mainly contributed to by plan curvature.

Naturally, there is an overestimation over concave, but underestimation of convex because of the limitation of coarse resolution (or footprint). However, this should be symmetrical bias and not as significant as what we observed in terms of negative skewness (Figure 1 b,c).

The color points indicate the aggregated mean value of the elevation difference. Plots (a), (b) and (c) depict the bias pattern along plan curvature, profile curvature, slope and canopy height before the bias correction. A triangle window (a) indicating a bias free condition, the rest of area either gives negative bias (blue) or positive bias (red). After the bias correction, most of the negative bias is removed (d, e, f). Plot (g) shows a schematic of curvature combinations. The plot reveals that there is a negative correlation between profile curvature and plan curvature.

#### Using h_te_mean, h_te_best_fit or h_te_best_fit_geosegments?

One concern is what the real resolution of the ICESat-2 ATL08 product is. Which elevation should I use? The real resolution of the ICESat-2 ATL08 product is not 100 meters. 100 m of segment is just how the dataset is structured, considering easy delivery of the canopy information in segments. There are several elevations provided by ATL08:

- h_te_mean: The real mean elevation of the segment. I have tried aggregating DTM1 by a certain window size and comparing the aggregated mean elevation with h_te_mean. However, there is no fixed window that is equivalent to the footprint of a segment (not 100 m or any other fixed value). The photons may not be evenly spread over either a 100 m long segment window or any other size.
- h_te_interp: h_te_interp is an interpolated value, which is generally worse than h_te_best_fit in many cases.
- h_te_best_fit: Good to use; however, when the geosegment has missing, it is very important to use subset_te_flag to exclude bad measurements. When five geosegments are available, the quality significantly improves.
- h_te_best_fit_20m_2: The best fit elevation at the midpoint of the segment.

In the beginning, I used h_te_best_fit; however, when the midpoint is not available, this value becomes an interpolated value (not sure if it equals h_te_interp). And this 'interpolated value' contains bias (generally tending to underestimate surface height). Therefore, using h_te_best_fit_20m_2 as the elevation of the midpoint of a segment eliminates any worry about interpolated values.

### DEM Bias Correction Model Based on ICESat-2 Snow-off Measurements

</div>

As mentioned, the difference between ICESat-2 and DEMs has been corrected by a model. What does the model tell us? I used SHAP to interpret the model's behavior.

The features used in the model are listed from the most influential on the top to the least influential on the bottom. A negative SHAP value means a negative bias (ICESat-2 - DEMs < 0), and vice versa. The feature value has been normalized to show positive or negative correlation. In general, most of the bias is negative. For instance, Figure 4 a shows the model using h_te_best_fit_20m_2. Here, the difference is defined as h_te_best_fit_20m_2 - h_te_best_fit. A positive difference (when h_te_best_fit_20m_2 > h_te_best_fit) normally contributes to a negative bias, which means h_te_best_fit has an even more severe negative skewness. This situation often occurs when only 2 to 4 geosegments are available (d). Other features that lead to negative bias include steep slope, convex terrain, canopy, and low standard deviation of ground photons, but positive skewness of ground photons. Additionally, TPI in a 270-meter scale is the least feature, meaning that the elevation difference is purely a micro topographic problem. For the model of COP30 - ICESat-2, the elevation difference is very related to vegetation coverage, canopy and TPI in 90 meters (3 pixel on COP30). **As the TPI behavior opposite with previous model, statistically, ICESat-2 has a better resolution than COP30.**

As demonstrated in figure 3, in figure 4 c, the behavior of negative bias is totally opposite on convex terrain (plan curvature > 0) and concave terrain (plan curvature < 0), which means that currently most of slope-only-dependent bias correction is not exactly correct.

Overall, the interpolation and slope correction algorithm of ICESat-2 ALT08 is quite interesting. However, it tends to underestimate surface height when there are no photons at the midpoint. Where h_te_best_fit_20m_2 is available, this algorithm may mistakenly consider it as part of the canopy and remove it. This tendency introduces residual bias, result in such as negative snow depth.

#### Is it Possible Using Negative Snow Depth in DEM Bias Correction?


Naturally, the distribution of dh is normal and symmetrical. When we are doing elevation differencing for snow depth, we also obtain snow depth with uncertainty in both tails. However, as the snow cover is very small relative to the uncertainties of DEMs-ICESat-2 (0.5m to 1m), many snow depth measurements (nearly 30%) result in negative values. Excluding these negative snow depths interferes significantly with small value observations. One idea is to use these snow-on measurements to further correct dh in an iterative process. It is very risky because such corrections are applied to specific terrains.
