Users upload information for free on LinkedIn, and the company charges them for the access to it. It is Google that provides search indexing that advertises the availability of the information. In order to keep up with Google's web crawlers, LinkedIn's servers disable login checks when they receive page requests from the search engine. 

This is also true for digital publications such as NY Times, Wall St Journal, Economist. When Google crawlers arrive, paywalls fall down. Ads are disabled to allow Googlebot to download pages faster. 

*Do not be surprised if your website is visited by a lot of search engine bots if you somehow have figured out how to optimize it for search engines.*

Searching Github for "LinkedIn scraper" turns up several open-source tools that advertise this exact functionality. It is likely that closed-source tools will perform even better than the publicly accessible ones. As you can see, making exceptions for a "whitelisted" partner will lead to this. 

**Any loophole on the internet will ultimately lead to open access, as we have learned.**
