_You may say, that's the nature of things_

&nbsp;&nbsp;... but it hurts all the same

_You may say, you did your best to avoid pain_

&nbsp;&nbsp;... but it hurts all the same

_You knew that the day will come where you need to be strong_

&nbsp;&nbsp;... but it hurts all the same

_You might say, "it's just a cat in the end"_

&nbsp;&nbsp;... but you are wrong

_He was my friend!_

_He was my family!_

_He was my hero!_
