Discussion on SB0834 starts from 1:55:55, and discussion on Amendment1 starts from 37:42.

## Dec 6, UT provided details of Tik Tok Ban

On **December 6**, in response to Jinning's request, the [Center for Global Engagement][CGE] provided details regarding Tennessee Law SB 0834 (HB 1445), also known as the TikTok Ban Law. This information is available at [Details regarding Tennessee Law -SB 0834/HB 1445 A.K.A “Tik Tok Ban Law”][CGE Details].

In the detailed second and third points, UTK clarified that it was the State of Tennessee, not the University of Tennessee, that created the law. Additionally, UTK claimed that the state legislation does not provide an exhaustive list of applications; the names mentioned are examples of known applications that are Chinese owned and operated.

However, these details did not clearly answer the question of ***HOW*** those apps were determined to be "known applications" for a "social media platform" and ***WHO*** made these determinations.

Jinning has tried to reach out to the campus leaders for further clarification.

## Nov 5, UTK leaders met with university members

<img src="/assets/img/poster/meeting.jpg" alt="meeting" title="Campus Leaders' Meeting" style="width: 550px; height: auto;">
Contact Jinning Wang at jwang175@vols.utk.edu if any copyright concerns.

On **November 5**, [Chancellor Donde Plowman][Donde Plowman] and her [Cabinet][Cabinet] met with the invited university members to discuss the Tik Tok ban.

At the beginning, attendees explored potential alternative apps and technologies that could be of assistance. Unfortunately, the discussion did not lead to any meaningful conclusions.

Subsequently, campus leaders introduced their ongoing pilot project aimed at helping the impacted community stay in touch with their families and friends in China. This project is expected to take a couple of weeks to complete preliminary test.

One suggestion from the students during the meeting was to consider providing financial support to the affected community as a means of mitigating the ban's impact.
However, campus leaders expressed concerns about whether university funding could be utilized in this manner.

Additionally, Jinning Wang wondered a justification for the list of banned apps, as he had been advocating for this since the beginning.
The campus leaders explained that both WeChat and TikTok had been explicitly mentioned during the legislative discussion, while other apps were added based on conventions followed by other institutions.

In the end, Jinning Wang made two requests of the university: 1) A written report detailing the university's involvement in the legislation process, internal discussions, and the criteria for app selection; 2) An email from the university expressing apologies to the impacted community for the lack of communication and demonstrating their support for the affected members.

The campus leaders agreed to comply with both requests.

## Sep 6, CFAAPI met with the UTK leaders

On **September 5**, [CFAAPI][CFAAPI] leaders were invited to meet with the [Chancellor Donde Plowman][Donde Plowman] and her leadership team. In this context, CFAAPI forwarded Jinning Wang's feedback to the campus leadership team.

Jinning Wang's letter is excerpted below, and he strongly advocates for the third mitigation measure, as he believes it will benefit the entire Volunteers:

Dear University of Tennessee Campus Leaders,

I would like to offer some suggestions regarding the recent Chinese app ban policy that has been implemented at our university.

In light of the Chinese app ban policy, our university faces several potential challenges that merit attention:

1. Compliance with State Government: As a subordinate institution to the state government, the university is obligated to follow government decisions, regardless of the decision's
   nature.
2. Lack of Awareness: Campus leaders may not be fully aware of the potential negative
   consequences associated with this policy.
3. Lack of Precedence: The university may not have encountered similar issues in the past,
   leading to uncertainty in handling this situation.
4. Lack of Appropriate Discussion with Impacted Communities: Adequate consultation and
   discussion with the communities affected by this policy may not have occurred, potentially leading to misunderstandings and concerns.

To address these challenges, I propose several mitigation measures:

1. Feedback Mechanism: To bridge the gap between the state government and the university's operational realities, establishing a feedback mechanism can help convey the challenges and complexities faced by our institution due to the app ban.
2. Task Force: Given the busy schedules of campus leaders, forming a dedicated task force comprising experts who can thoroughly analyze the policy's impact and potential alternatives could be more effective and practical.
3. Transparency through Reporting: Publish a comprehensive report detailing the timeline of the university's involvement in the legislation process, internal discussions, and the criteria for app selection. This report would provide valuable insights to all volunteers and help create a more balanced policy.
4. Suspending the Controversial Policy: Considering the potential negative impact and lack of convincing justification, it may be prudent to temporarily suspend the controversial policy until further convincing evidence or justifications are provided.

Your dedication to ensuring the best interests of the university and its community is greatly appreciated.
Thank you for considering these suggestions, and I look forward to seeing how we can collectively navigate this issue.

## May 5, CGE hosted a listening session

On **May 5**, [Center for Global Engagement][CGE] hosted a listening session to support the Chinese community.
In the session, university members from various backgrounds expressed their concerns and suggesstions, following excerpted part of commonts from listening session.

***Comment 1: Passive UTK Leadership***

I felt that the UTK leadership who participated in the Listening Session merely strived to explain their obligations in complying with the law.
Unfortunately, this is a passive approach that shows the ineptitude of their leadership skill.

The bigger question is that if they genuinely believe in diversity, equity and inclusion, and they aim to establish the Institute of American Civics with a goal of preventing social division, why wouldn’t they actively advocate and express their disagreement with such anti-Asian law?

The UTK leadership did not show any willingness to do so, but merely whitewash their actions.
This is called condescension to the AAPI community.

***Comment 2: Poor Mobile Signal***

Some people might say just use your own data if you cannot use WiFi in campus. But the thing is that in most school buildings, the signal is so poor.
For example, when using mint mobile and now in student union, one can barely use phone network because there is no any signal.

Then, the question is: is it possible for the university to improve the signal in the campus or provide a funding for the impacted community to transfer to other mobile operators with better service.

***Comment 3: Possible Support***

Technical support: OIT provides VPN download.

Emotional support: Sending encouraging emails to students, faculty, and staff.


***Comment 4: Disparity in User Numbers***

*Background*

Huge difference in number of users among TikTok and other Chinese apps.
As we know, TikTok's popularity exploded in the US in 2019 and 2020, with millions of users joining the platform and creating and sharing short videos. As of 2021, TikTok had over 100 million monthly active users in the United States.

This number is based on data from the app analytics company App Annie and represents a significant increase from the approximately 40 million monthly active users TikTok had in the US in 2019.
TikTok has become one of the most popular social media apps in the US, particularly among younger users

However, the majority users of WeChat and other apps are located in China.
According to the United States Census Bureau, as of the latest available data from 2020, the Asian population in Tennessee was estimated to be approximately 100,745, which represents about 1.5% of the state's total population.
However, it is important to note that the Asian population in Tennessee is not a homogeneous group and includes individuals from many different ethnic and cultural backgrounds.

And the Chinese population in Tennessee was estimated to be approximately 12,070, which represents about 0.2% of the state's total population.
That means about 13% of total Asians in Tennessee may have Chinese background. According to the University of Tennessee's Fact Book for Fall 2021, there were 1,066 international students enrolled at the university, and of those, 397 were from Asia. Let’s do a rough calculation, if we use the 13% times the 397, there are just about 52 students may have Chinese background.

*Q1*

Does it make sense to put WeChat, Sina Weibo, Tencent QQ, Tencent Video, Xiao HongShu, Douban, Zhihu, Meituan, and Toutiao at the same position on the same level of significance of TikTok considering the so called “National security concerns”?

*Q2*

Would the university of Tennessee consider this to be a form of segregation and unjust treatment of minorities of Chinese international students and staffs?
Would University of Tennessee consider the potential impact of increasing community hatred towards Asian students?
Are there any ways to handle those potential negative impacts?

*Q3*

This member shared a personal story, given privacy concern, this part was not displayed here.

The third question is that:
Is that possible for University of Tennessee to ban TikTok only in the campus instead of all the Chinese apps in the list?

***Comment 5: Policy and Volunteer Spirit***

*Q1*

In the email from the IT department, it was mentioned that nine apps, including WeChat, Sina Weibo, Tencent QQ, Tencent Video, Xiao HongShu, Douban, Zhihu, Meituan, and Toutiao, were banned.

However, it is not clear why these specific apps were selected for the ban.
Could the university provide more information on the criteria used to determine which apps were banned as social media platforms?

*Q2*

The recent policy banning certain Chinese social media platforms has had significant impacts on certain groups of university members.
However, there was no prior information or discussion with the university community before the ban was implemented.

To ensure transparency in policy making and address the concerns of the affected community members, could the university provide information on the process by which this policy was developed and implemented?

*Q3*

Given the IT department's quick implementation of the policy, it is important to ensure that the policy complies with the regulations and standards of the University of Tennessee.

Is there a double-checking process in place to double-check the policy's consistency with the university's standards and regulations?

*Q4*

Tennessee General Assembly, the bill was signed by Governor on 04/13/2023.
On 9:10 AM 04/14/2023, an email from the University, informed the implemented ban.
On 3:PM 05/05/2023, a listening session to support Chinese community was held.

Why was there a significant difference in response time between the legislation, which was responded to within 24 hours, and the university members, who had to wait 22 days for a response?

*Q5*

The Volunteer Spirit is a philosophy of service and leadership deeply ingrained in the University of Tennessee's culture and history.

This spirit is rooted in the region's history of volunteerism and emphasizes the importance of giving back to the community through service and leadership.
This philosophy extends beyond the university's students to include its faculty, staff, and alumni.

Alongside its technical innovations, the university's unique character of Volunteer Spirit is a defining aspect of its identity.
Through their dedication to giving back, the Volunteer family is changing lives for the better, in the city, state, country, and around the world.

Today, we have some Chinese students, staff, and faculty attending this talk.
These individuals have left their homes and crossed the Pacific Ocean to work and live here.
Some will leave the university after completing their studies or work, going on to make a difference in the world with the knowledge and skills they gained here.
However, the more important thing is the Volunteer Spirit that the university instills in its members.

Now, there is a chance for the university to make a difference.
Will the university seize this chance to show its commitment to service and leadership, or will it leave our Chinese colleagues alone, again?

一个国际学生对中国应用禁令进展的观察：州立法、大学政策、以及在田纳西大学受影响的群体。

## 12月6日,学校提供TikTok禁令的详细信息

**12月6日**，作为对王晋宁的要求的回应，CGE 提供了有关田纳西州法律SB 0834（HB 1445）的详细信息，也称为Tik Tok禁令法。这些信息可在[有关田纳西州法律SB 0834（HB 1445）的详细信息][CGE Details]中查看。

在详细的第二和第三点中，UTK澄清，制定该法律的是田纳西州，而不是田纳西大学。此外，UTK声称，州立法并未提供应用程序的详尽列表；提到的名称只是已知的中国拥有和运营的应用程序的示例。

然而，这些细节并没有清楚地回答这样一个问题：对于“社媒平台”来说，***如何***确定这些应用是“已知应用”，以及***何人***做出这些决定。

王晋宁试图与校领导取得联系以获取进一步的澄清。

## 11月5日，校领导与大学成员会谈

**11月5日**，校长 [Donde Plowman][Donde Plowman] 及其[内阁][Cabinet]与受邀的大学成员会面，讨论 Tik Tok 禁令。

一开始，与会者探讨了可能有助于解决问题的潜在替代应用程序和技术。不幸的是，讨论没有达成任何有意义的结论。

随后，校领导介绍了他们正在进行的旨在帮助受影响社区与其在中国的家人和朋友保持联系的试点项目。该项目预计需要数周时间来完成初步测试。

与会期间，学生提出了一个建议，考虑提供财政支持来减轻禁令对受影响社区的影响。然而，校领导对于是否可以利用大学资金进行该项活动提出了担忧。

此外，王晋宁对被禁应用名单的选取提出疑问，一如该事件开始时那样。
校领导解释说，立法讨论中明确提到了 WeChat 和 TikTok，而其他应用是根据其他机构的惯例添加的。

最后，王晋宁提出了两项要求：1）提供一份详细说明大学在立法过程、内部讨论以及应用选择标准方面的明细；2）大学通过电子邮件向受影响社区表示道歉，表达对受影响成员的支持。

校领导同意满足这两项要求。

## 9月5日，CFAAPI与校长及其领导团队的会议

**9月5日**，[CFAAPI][CFAAPI] 领导受邀与校长 [Donde Plowman][Donde Plowman] 及校领导团队会面。在此背景下，CFAAPI将王晋宁的反馈意见转交给了校领导团队。

王晋宁的信函如下节选，并且他坚持第三项弥补措施，因为他认为这将使全体志愿者受益：

尊敬的田纳西大学校领导：

我想就最近在我们大学实施的中国App禁令政策提出一些建议。

考虑到中国App禁令政策，我们大学面临一些需要关注的潜在挑战：

1. 遵守州政府法规：作为州政府的从属机构，大学有义务遵守政府的决定，无论其性质如何。
2. 缺乏认识：校园领导可能未能充分认识到与这一政策相关的潜在负面后果。
3. 缺乏先例：大学可能以前没有遇到类似的问题，这可能导致在处理这种情况时伴有不确定性。
4. 与受影响群体缺乏适当的讨论：可能尚未与受该政策影响的社区进行充分的咨询和讨论，这可能导致误解和担忧。

为解决这些挑战，我提出以下几项缓解措施：

1. 反馈机制：为了弥合州政府与大学实际运营之间的差距，建立反馈机制有助于传达由于App禁令而使我们单位面临的挑战和复杂性。
2. 工作组：鉴于校领导的繁忙工作日程，成立一个由专家组成的工作组，可以对政策的影响和潜在替代方案进行彻底分析，可能更加有效和切实可行。
3. 通过报告实现透明度：公开一份详尽的报告，详细描述大学参与立法过程的时间线，内部讨论以及App选择标准。这份报告将为所有志愿者提供有价值的见解，有助于制定更加平衡的政策。
4. 暂停有争议的政策：考虑到潜在的负面影响和缺乏令人信服的理由，暂时暂停有争议的政策可能是明智的，直到提供进一步令人信服的证据或理由。

感谢您致力于确保大学及其社区的权益。感谢您考虑这些建议，期待我们共同解决这个问题。

王晋宁

## 5月5日，CGE举行主题为支持中国社区的听证会

**5月5日**，[CGE][CGE] 举办了一场支持中国社区的听证会。
会上，来自不同背景的大学成员表达了他们的关注和建议，部分讨论内容如下：

***评论1：学校领导团队的消极应对***

在倾听会上，我感觉学校领导只是努力解释他们遵守法律的义务。遗憾的是，这种被动的方法显示出他们领导能力的不足。

更重要的问题是，如果他们真的相信多样性、平等和包容，并且他们的目标是建立美国公民研究所以防止社会分裂，为什么他们不积极提倡并表达对这种反亚洲法律的反对？

UTK领导并未表现出这样的意愿，只是粉饰他们的行为。这是对亚太裔群体的纡尊降贵。

***评论2：糟糕的手机信号***

有些人可能会说，如果你不能在校园里使用WiFi，就用你自己的数据。但问题是，在大多数学校建筑里，信号非常差。例如，在学生会堂使用mint mobile时，一个人几乎无法使用手机网络，因为几乎没有信号。

那么，问题是：大学是否有可能改善校园内的信号，或者为受影响的社区提供资金，以便他们转到其他具有更好服务的移动运营商

***评论3：可能的支持***

技术支持：OIT提供VPN下载。

情感支持：给学生、教师和员工发送鼓励性的电子邮件。

***评论4：用户数量的差异***

*背景*

TikTok与其他中国应用程序之间的用户数量存在巨大差异。
众所周知，TikTok在2019年和2020年在美国的受欢迎程度激增，数百万用户加入平台，创作和分享短视频。截至2021年，TikTok在美国的月活跃用户超过1亿。

这个数字是基于应用程序分析公司App Annie的数据，与2019年TikTok在美国的约4000万月活跃用户相比，有了显著增长。
TikTok已成为美国最受欢迎的社交媒体应用之一，尤其是在年轻用户中。

然而，微信和其他应用的大多数用户位于中国。
根据美国人口普查局的数据，截至2020年的最新数据，田纳西州的亚裔人口估计为100,745人，占州总人口的约1.5%。
然而，值得注意的是，田纳西州的亚裔人口并非一个同质的群体，包括来自许多不同种族和文化背景的个人。

田纳西州的华人人口估计为12,070人，占州总人口的约0.2%。
这意味着田纳西州约13%的亚洲人可能有中国背景。根据田纳西大学2021年秋季学期的事实手册，该校有1,066名国际学生入学，其中397名来自亚洲。让我们进行一个粗略的计算，如果我们用13%乘以397，就有大约52名学生可能有中国背景。

*问题1*

考虑到所谓的“国家安全问题”，将微信、新浪微博、腾讯QQ、腾讯视频、小红书、豆瓣、知乎、美团和头条与TikTok放在同一位置、同一重要程度上是否合理？

*问题2*

田纳西大学是否认为这是对华人国际学生和工作人员的一种隔离和不公正对待？
田纳西大学是否考虑了对亚裔学生的社区仇恨可能增加的潜在影响？
有没有办法处理这些潜在的负面影响？

*问题3*

这位成员分享了一段个人经历，为保护隐私，该部分不予显示。
第三个问题是：
田纳西大学是否有可能只在校园内禁止TikTok，而不是列表中的所有中国应用？

***评论5：政策与志愿者精神***

*问题1*

在IT部门的邮件中提到，禁止了包括微信、新浪微博、腾讯QQ、腾讯视频、小红书、豆瓣、知乎、美团和头条在内的九款应用。

然而，目前还不清楚为什么这些特定的应用被选为禁止之列。
大学能否提供更多关于用于确定哪些应用作为社交媒体平台被禁止的标准的信息？

*问题2*

最近禁止某些中国社交媒体平台的政策对一些大学成员群体产生了重大影响。
然而，在实施禁令之前，并未与大学社区进行事先的信息沟通或讨论。

为确保政策制定的透明度，并解决受影响社区成员的担忧，大学是否能提供关于该政策是如何制定和实施的过程的信息？

*问题3*

考虑到IT部门对政策的快速实施，确保政策符合田纳西大学的规定和标准非常重要。

是否有一个双重检查流程来确保政策与大学的标准和规定保持一致？

*问题4*

田纳西州议会，州长在2023年4月13日签署了这项法案。
2023年4月14日上午9:10，大学发出邮件通知实施禁令。
2023年5月5日下午3点，举行了一场支持中国社区的听证会。

为什么在立法与大学成员之间的响应时间上存在如此显著的差异？立法得到24小时内的回应，而大学成员则不得不等待22天才得到回应？

*问题5*

志愿者精神是一种深深植根于田纳西大学文化和历史的服务和领导力理念。

这种精神源于该地区志愿服务的历史，强调通过服务和领导力回馈社区的重要性。
这种理念不仅包括大学的学生，还包括其教职员工和校友。

作为大学特色的志愿者精神与其技术创新并重，是其身份的决定性因素。
通过他们对回馈的奉献，志愿者们正在改变着不同城市、州、国家乃至世界各地人们的生活。

今天，我们有一些中国学生、教职员工和教师参加了这次会谈。
这些人离开了家园，穿越太平洋来到这里工作和生活。
有些人将在完成学业或工作后离开大学，凭借在这里获得的知识和技能为世界带来变革。
然而，更重要的是大学在成员身上培养的志愿者精神。

现在，大学有机会发挥作用。
大学会抓住这次机会展示其对志愿者精神和领导力的付出，还是会再次让我们的中国同事孤独无援？

## 5月3日，王晋宁对UT中国应用禁令的观点

**5月3日**，王晋宁发表了《关于中国应用禁令，田纳西大学可以遵守州法律并保护个人权利》，全文如下。

SB0843于1月30日提交，旨在禁止向学生、教职员工或公众提供互联网接入的公立高等教育机构允许个人使用该机构的网络访问总部位于美国以外的公司拥有的视频平台。
然后，在3月2日，通过了对该法案的修正案1，将范围具体化为由中华人民共和国境内的公司运营或托管的社交媒体平台。

***田纳西大学对TikTok法案的迅速反应***

在州长 Bill Lee 于4月13日签署法案后，田纳西大学信息技术和创新副校长兼首席信息官 Ramon Padilla 代表田纳西大学，于4月14日发送了一封电子邮件，通知田纳西大学系统关于新实施的“TikTok法”。

在未事先通知学生的情况下，田纳西大学在校园网络上封锁了微信、新浪微博、腾讯QQ、腾讯视频、小红书、豆瓣、知乎、美团和头条。

***政策的潜在欠妥之处***

尽管封锁某些社交媒体平台的政策可能是出于好意实施的，但这项政策有可能被认为是不当或令人担忧的。

学校在缺乏事先通知与讨论讨论的情况下实施了这项政策，这使得学生与教职员工产生费解和沮丧。

在实施该政策的决策过程中，缺乏透明度和包容性，这引发了对大学是否致力于在涉及他们的问题上与社区所有成员互动的担忧。

为了促进更具包容性和透明度的决策过程，大学在政策制定和实施过程中积极与社区所有成员，特别是国际学生和学者互动至关重要。这将确保大学考虑到多元化的观点，并促进包容和公平的文化。

***对法律的过度反应***

相关法律旨在社交媒体平台，但大学的禁令涵盖了广泛的应用程序，却没有提供详细的理由。例如，微信主要是一种面向个人通信的私人消息服务，而不是社交媒体平台。

按照美国国务院领事事务局的指导，来自中国的社交媒体平台包括豆瓣、Qzone（QQ）、新浪微博、腾讯微博和优酷。

此外，该局指导申请人说：“请提供您想要列出的每个社交媒体平台的名称和相关的唯一社交媒体标识符（用户名或句柄）。这不包括像WhatsApp这样的面向个人通信的私人消息服务。”

田纳西大学的禁令似乎是对仅涉及社交媒体平台的法律的不成比例反应。这尤其令人担忧，因为微信主要是一种私人消息服务，而不是像DS-160表格上列出的那些社交媒体平台。此外，缺乏对选定应用的明确理由引发了对依赖这些应用进行个人沟通的用户产生负面影响的担忧。

***向田纳西大学发出呼吁***

在对学校就最近封禁某些社交媒体平台的政策提出关注进行评估之后，我作为一名志愿者，强烈敦促田纳西大学采取行动，重新审视该政策。

倾听社区成员的声音并以透明和包容的方式解决他们的担忧至关重要。重新评估政策可能涉及对其进行完善或修改，以确保其符合大学推动包容、尊重和多样性的价值观。

虽然大学有义务遵守州法律，但同样重要的是保护个人权利，确保所有志愿者，包括特定群体的权利不受侵犯。

大学可以探索更好的行动，以实现遵守州法律的义务与保护个人权利的义务的共存。

***减轻负面影响***

此外，作者呼吁大学积极努力减轻政策实施所产生的负面后果。

这可能涉及修改政策，以确定校园内合理的禁用应用程序列表。为实现这一目标，大学应主动与受影响的学生和学者互动，了解影响的范围并相应地解决他们的担忧。

另外，大学应探索为受政策影响的人提供替代资源和支持，例如提供补充援助和访问其他社交媒体平台的途径。

通过采取这些措施，大学可以展示其对培养所有学生的热情和包容的学习环境的坚定承诺，无论他们来自哪个国家。

***致谢***

作为一名自豪的志愿者，作者感谢田纳西大学持续建设一个安全和包容的学术和学习环境。

此外，作者感谢其他志愿者的帮助，包括但不限于《The Daily Beacon》的及时报道和CGE即将举行的支持中国社区的听证会。

在我们努力寻求更加平衡的方式来解决各种关切时，我们承认并感激大学通过其政策和举措坚定地致力于培养一个多样化、公平和包容的社区。
