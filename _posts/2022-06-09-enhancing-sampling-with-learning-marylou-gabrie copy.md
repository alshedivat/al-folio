Motivated by sequential budgeted allocation problems, we investigate
online matching problems on classes of random graphs. In particular,
we look at the so-called configuration model and geometric random graphs.
We estimate the competitive ratio of the simplest algorithm, GREEDY, by
approximating some relevant stochastic discrete processes by their continuous
counterparts, that are solutions of an explicit system of partial differential
equations. This technique gives precise bounds on the estimation errors, with
arbitrarily high probability as the problem size increases. In particular, it
 allows the formal comparison between different configuration models. We also
 prove that, quite surprisingly, GREEDY can have better performance guarantees
 than RANKING, another celebrated algorithm for online matching that usually
 outperforms the former.
