<h2>Moin Moin,</h2>

<p>recently I stayed at home for two months because my second daughter Naya was born 20th January 2010. Here in Germany we have the possibility to take the so called &#8220;Elternzeit&#8221; which is badly translated as &#8220;parents time&#8221;. It gives you and your partner the chance to take care of the new born. </p>

<p>Most of the time I tried do be a good daddy and husband. Means I supported my wife as much as I could and carried Naya around while she was screaming like hell (due to 3 month colics a lot of babys have at the beginning of their life). But there was some time left I used to learn again some programming stuff like digging a little deeper into Rails and hacking JavaScript. Neat.</p>

<p>Doing so and due to the fact I am programming web based stuff, I likely use Firefox. But hey there is also that Google Chrome browser you installed few months ago. So why not using this one. And yeah - it&#8217;s really cool. I like the simplicity and reduced UI. But what about extensions? Ok there is the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions" target="_blank">Google Chrome Extensions</a> site I checked. And there are already some cool extensions I use.</p>

<h3>Overview about the installed extensions</h3>

<p>This is just a short hint. You can find the extensions menu under Window -&gt; Extensions or you click the &#8220;Customize and control Google Chrome&#8221; button (tool icon) in the adress bar and then the entry Extensions in the menu. There is a list with all installed extensions and you are given the ability to change the options, enable or disable and uninstall each extension.</p>

<h3>Firebug lite</h3>

<p>The one I installed some minutes ago is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bmagokdooijbeehmkpknfglimnifench" target="_blank">Firebug lite for Chrome</a>.  Actually this version is just a smaller set of the one written for Firefox but hey, it&#8217;s a good start. When developing JavaScript stuff, the most used part is the Console and fortunately it&#8217;s already available. I did not know that this Firebug version is available for Chrome. So a big thank you goes to Markus Wolff (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/mwolffhh" target="_blank">@mwolffhh</a>) who pointed me to this.</p>

<h3>goo.gl URL Shortener</h3>

<p>Who does not use an URL shortener these day&#8217;s? Sure there are a lot of them available. Having one in your browser bar available is a good thing because you just need to hit it and have the shortened URL for the actual page. I like the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/iblijlcdoidgdpfknkckljiocdbnlagk" target="_blank">goo.gl Extension</a> a lot but it&#8217;s nothing very special.</p>

<h3>Google Reader Notifier</h3>

<p>First I was reading the RSS feeds I subscribed to in Mail. But this sucks a little bit, because it&#8217;s a mail client and not an RSS reader. So I started to use Google reader and I am really satisfied. So to quickly open the site and also seeing how many new feeds are available, I installed <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/oaeemlcgfejmkohaddjlhnmaneccmbfb" target="_blank">Google Reader Notifier</a> which is made by Google. This is basically just a link to the Google reader site.</p>

<h3>Speed Tracer</h3>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ognampngfcbddbfemdapefohjiobgbdl" target="_blank">Speed Trace</a>r is also a Google extension. It is useful to examine performance problems. You start recording all the pages you are loading. A lot of important metrics are being tracked. Actually I just used it a couple of times but it seems to be a good tool. To be able to run it under Mac OS X you have to download a litte application called <a href="http://dl.google.com/gwt/speedtracer/ChromeWithSpeedTracer.dmg" target="_blank">Speed Tracer bootstrap application</a>. Running this app will start Chrome with the flag
</p><pre>--enable-extension-timeline-api</pre> which is needed to be able to record anything at all. It&#8217;s worth a check I think. You can get further info <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/speedtracer/get-started.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h3>Zootool Extension</h3>

<p>Last, but definitely not least, there is a wonderful extension available for <a href="http://www.zootool.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.zootool.com" target="_blank">www.zootool.com</a></a> which I strongly recommend to check out. Zootool (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/zootool" target="_blank">@zootool</a>) is a web application for storing and managing your bookmarks running in the browser as a website. The cool thing about it is the fact, that it feels like using a desktop application.  The extension is opening the save dialog embedded fullscreen in your current window. Really nice! (hey <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bastianallgeier" target="_blank">Bastian</a>, I am still really excited ;-)</p>

<h3>While developing</h3>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to miss to point you to the developer tools shipped with Chrome. Under View -&gt; Developer in the main menu, you can open the source code of the current page,   the Developer Tools and the JavaScript console, and a task manager showing you the ressources used by Chrome. The Developer Tools and the JavaScript console are made in the manner of firebug for Firefox. They are doing a real good job what means, that you can easily use Chrome for developing JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This was just a small overview about some extensions for Google Chrome. I am using it under Mac OS X. Chrome is a real nice browser and damn fast. The V8 JavaScript engine is doing a good job under the hood. So why not using Chrome?</p>
