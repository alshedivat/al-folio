description: High-level perspective on habits based on science and some of the tips for developing good habits (and geting rid of bad ones).

I plan to write a peer-reviewed blog post on the cognitive science for developing habits (and post on sciencenonfiction.org). This is becoming increasingly important due to COVID-19 and the pervasiveness of social media, etc. There are a lot of good resources on this topic, but I hope to offer a more scientific view along with some tips that work for me. Here is just my first draft, consisting of mostly disorganized ideas and resources.

## Science
Addiction is essentially bad habits. Science of addiction - dopamine and our reward circuit. Why do we like to be lazy? Short-term pleasures (least effort)> long-term consistency (More effort). Cue -> action -> reward. Action -> routine, wire our reward circuit.

## Tips

1. Start small
2. Be strict
3. Be Consistent
4. Grow

(optional) remove distractions/obstacles
(optional) accountability (habit tracker, partner)

## Why technology is not humane

[I may write in this or another post on how companies profits from our attention and hence wants to keep us addicted and misinformed (misinformation is worth more than information) - quick resoures: Social Dilemma (netflix), Humane Technology]

## Personal:
My [weekly schedule]({% post_url 2020-09-06-Reflection_week1 %}) is developed through baby steps. 

## Resources:
### Books (most helpful)
* Atomic Habits by James Clear - a practical books where some of these ideas are based off of. I included the ones I feel are most important 
* Deep Work by Cal Newport - Examples and reasons for how and why single-pointed focus is producing the best work.
* (optional) Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport - Tips on minimalizing time wasted on the computer, cellphone, etc. (which some of us struggle with)


### Apps/Hardware (helpful at least initially)
* Freedom - Schedule time for blocking non-essential/distracting websites. Currently, I block them from 10:00pm to 6:00pm M-F (20 hours). Easy to sync across devices.
* Cold Turkey - Alternative to Freedom 
* Forest - Cellphone App (not using)
* Kitchen Safe - (not using, but could be helpful)
