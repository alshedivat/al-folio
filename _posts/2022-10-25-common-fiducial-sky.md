In this document we plan do describe a set of fiducial sky models that can be used for simulation purposes by all Cosmic Microwave Background experiments to simplify the work of comparing their performance and perform joint analysis.

## Galactic Foregrounds

For the foreground components we recommend 3 different sky models of increasing level of complexity so that analysis pipelines can be tested in different scenarios.

For each model we specify the most important features, check [in the PySM 3 documentation](https://pysm3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html) for more details.

### Low complexity

PySM 3 emissions: `d9,s4,f1,a1,co1`

* Dust: Modified Black Body spectrum with Planck GNILC templates with small scales generated in Polarization Fraction Tensor formalism up to $$N_{side} =8192$$, $$\ell_{max}=16384$$, fixed spectral index of 1.48 and black body temperature to 19.6 K.
* Synchrotron: Power law model with templates from Haslam in temperature and WMAP 9 year 23 GHz in polarization, small scales in Polarization Fraction Tensor formalism up to $$N_{side} =8192$$, $$\ell_{max}=16384$$, fixed spectral index of -3.1.
* Free-free: PySM 2 Free-free model based on Commander up to $$N_{side}=512$$
* AME: PySM 2 un-polarized AME model based on Commander up to $$N_{side}=512$$
* CO: Galactic CO emissions of 3 main lines from Planck MILCA, un-polarized, $$N_{side}=2048$$

### Medium complexity

PySM 3 emissions: `d10,s5,f1,a1,co3`

* Dust: Low-complexity + GNILC spectral index and black body temperature maps with small scales added
* Synchrotron: Low-complexity + spectral index maps with small scales added
* Free-free: Low-complexity
* AME: Low-complexity
* CO: Low-complexity + .1% polarization

### High complexity

PySM 3 emissions: `d12,s7,f1,a2,co3`

* Dust: 3D model of polarized dust emission with 6 layers, MKD, $$N_{side}=2048$$
* Synchrotron: Medium-complexity + curvature map from ARCADE with small scales added
* Free-free: Low-complexity
* AME: Low-complexity + 2% polarization
* CO: Medium-complexity
