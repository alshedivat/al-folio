In this document we plan do describe a set of fiducial sky models that can be used for simulation purposes by all Cosmic Microwave Background experiments to simplify the work of comparing their performance and perform joint analysis.

## Galactic Foregrounds

For the foreground components we recommend 3 different sky models of increasing level of complexity so that analysis pipelines can be tested in different scenarios.

For each model we specify the most important features, check [in the PySM 3 documentation](https://pysm3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html) for more details.

### Optimistic model

PySM 3 emissions: `d9,s4,f1,a1,co1`

* Dust: Modified Black Body spectrum with Planck GNILC templates with small scales generated in Polarization Fraction Tensor formalism up to $N_{side} =8192$, $\ell_{max}=16384$, fixed spectral index of 1.48 and black body temperature to 19.6 K.
* Synchrotron: Power law model with templates from Haslam in temperature and WMAP 9 year 23 GHz in polarization, small scales in Polarization Fraction Tensor formalism up to $N_{side} =8192$, $\ell_{max}=16384$, fixed spectral index of -3.1.
* Free-free: PySM 2 Free-free model based on Commander up to $N_{side}=512$
* AME: PySM 2 un-polarized AME model based on Commander up to $N_{side}=512$
* CO: Galactic CO emissions of 3 main lines from Planck MILCA, un-polarized, $N_{side}=2048$

### Bestguess model

PySM 3 emissions: `d10,s5,f1,a1,co3`

* Dust: Optimistic + GNILC spectral index and black body temperature maps with small scales added
* Synchrotron: Optimistic + spectral index maps with small scales added
* Free-free: Optimistic
* AME: Optimistic
* CO: Optimistic + .1% polarization

### Pessimistic

PySM 3 emissions: `d12,s7,f1,a2,co3`

* Dust: 3D model of polarized dust emission with 6 layers, MKD, $N_{side}=2048$
* Synchrotron: Bestguess + curvature map from ARCADE with small scales added
* Free-free: Optimistic
* AME: Optimistic + 2% polarization
* CO: Bestguess

## Extragalactic Foregrounds

Extragalactic maps are based on [Websky](https://mocks.cita.utoronto.ca/index.php/WebSky_Extragalactic_CMB_Mocks) simulations.

* CIB: Interpolated from maps generated by the model at $N_{side}=4096$
* tSZ, kSZ: Thermal and Kinetic SZ maps at $N_{side}=4096$

## Cosmic Microwave Background

Using the same cosmological parameters of Websky for compatibility with the Extragalactic components:

$$
    \Omega_b = 0.049
    \Omega_c = 0.261
    \Omega_m = \Omega_b + \Omega_c
    h = 0.68
    n_s = 0.965
    A_s = 2.022e-9
    N_{eff} = 3.046
    \tau = 0.055
$$

Lensed with the potential estimated by Websky.
Produce Lensed and Unlensed CMB sky scalar only, and then a separate tensor component with the adequate value of $r$ and tensor spectral index ($n_t$) equal to 0.
