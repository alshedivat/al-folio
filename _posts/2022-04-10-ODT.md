## Motivation 

<!-- <aside> -->
💡 An online algorithms, which access to offline data can have zero or even negative effect on the online performance.

<!-- </aside> -->


## Contribution

1. **Exploration:** 

    > We shift from deterministic to stochastic policies for defining exploration objectives during the online phase.

2. **A New Replay Buffer:**

    > We develop a novel replay buffer consistent with the architecture and training protocol of ODT


## Methodology

1. This paper combines DT with SAC, which adopt a maximum-entropy idea to encourage the exploration in fine-tuning.
2. Minor changes:
    1. Change replay buffer from saving transitions to trajectories.
    2. Utilizing HER to improve the sample-efficiency in sparse rewards settings.
    3. Sampling strategy.

<!-- <aside>
❓ what is cross conditional entropy?
