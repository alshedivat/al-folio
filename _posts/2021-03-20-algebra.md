description: useful algebraic techniques for cryptography 
---

Asymptotic efficiency is critical to the practical implementation of cryptographic primitives such as ECC, NIZK, MPC, etc. Below is a brief introduction to two widely used algebraic building blocks.

#### Fast Fourier Transformation

**Used in zksnark, zkstark for proving; polynomial commitment construction**

*FTT* speeds up the multiplication of two polynomials of length $$n$$ in $$O(n \log n)$$ time, which is better than the trivial multiplication which takes $$O(n^2)$$ time.

In its essence, *FTT* implements a recursive algorithm by leveraging the property that discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix is highly symmetric (due to the symmetry and periodicity properties of $$e^{ix}$$)

Wonderful 3blue1brown-ish [animated explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7apO7q16V0){:target="\_blank"}.

C++ template for *FTT* and *inverse FTT*:

{% highlight c++ %}
using cd = complex<double>;
const double PI = acos(-1);

void fft(vector<cd> & a, bool invert) {
    int n = a.size();
    if (n == 1)
        return;

    vector<cd> a0(n / 2), a1(n / 2);
    for (int i = 0; 2 * i < n; i++) {
        a0[i] = a[2*i];
        a1[i] = a[2*i+1];
    }
    fft(a0, invert);
    fft(a1, invert);

    double ang = 2 * PI / n * (invert ? -1 : 1);
    cd w(1), wn(cos(ang), sin(ang));
    for (int i = 0; 2 * i < n; i++) {
        a[i] = a0[i] + w * a1[i];
        a[i + n/2] = a0[i] - w * a1[i];
        if (invert) {
            a[i] /= 2;
            a[i + n/2] /= 2;
        }
        w *= wn;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<hr>
Limitation:
- In double-precision floating point arithmetic, most implementation deals with polynomials of size $$10^5$$ with small coefficients, or equivalently multiplying two numbers of size $$10^6$$.
