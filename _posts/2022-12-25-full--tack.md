#### Q: what is the Difference between Data Scientist and Full Stack Data Scientist?

A data scientist is typically someone who has a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and computer science, and is skilled at using these tools to extract insights from data. They might work with a variety of data sources and use a range of techniques to analyze and interpret the data, including machine learning algorithms and statistical modeling.

A full stack data scientist is similar to a data scientist, but with the **added ability to work with data at all stages of the data pipeline**. This might include tasks such as **data collection and ingestion, data storage and management, data processing and transformation, and data visualization and reporting**. Full stack data scientists are often comfortable working with a variety of tools and technologies and have the ability to design and build complete data pipelines.

#### Q: What is the Difference between Geodata Scientist and Data Scientist?

A geodata scientist is a type of data scientist who specializes in working with geospatial data. This may include analyzing, visualizing, and modeling geodata using GIS software and other specialized tools. 

A data scientist, on the other hand, is a professional who uses data to extract insights, inform decision making, and solve problems in a variety of contexts. While both roles may involve working with data, a geodata scientist is likely to have a more specific focus on geospatial data and the use of GIS techniques.

#### Q: In the long Run, I want to Be a Full Stack Data Scientist with a Focus on Geodata, what I Can Do?

Sure! It sounds like you have a clear idea of where you want to go in your career. To achieve your goal of becoming a full stack data scientist with a focus on geodata, there are a few steps you might consider taking:

1.  Data Engineering: This involves working with large datasets and developing the infrastructure to store, process, and analyze the data. This could include learning programming languages such as Python or Java, as well as technologies like `Hadoop` and `Spark`.
2.  Data Visualization: Being able to effectively communicate your findings through data visualization is important in any data science role. You may want to learn tools like `Tableau` or `D3.js` to enhance your visualization skills.
3.  Machine Learning: As a geodata scientist, you may want to focus on machine learning techniques that are particularly relevant to geospatial data. This could include spatial statistics and geostatistics, as well as advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning.
4.  Front-End Development: As a full stack geodata scientist, you should also have some proficiency in front-end development. This could involve learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like `React` or `Angular`.

Overall, the key to becoming a full stack geodata scientist is to continually learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and techniques in the field. This may involve taking online courses, participating in hackathons, or contributing to open source projects.


#### Q: So, for Those Areas You just Recommended, Can You Give the name of the Book or Courses that I Can Go and Start Study Immediately
