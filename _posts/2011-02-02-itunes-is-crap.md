<p>&#8230; I hate fucking iTunes. This bullshit software is just annoying me and makes me absolutely angry. </p>

<p>The usability is simply crap and what really made me nuts was the fact, that I did not find a - &#8220;Mac makes it simple&#8221;  - way to move purchased Apps from the iPad to the Mac.</p>

<p>Ok - connecting the iPad to the MBP opens iTunes. And the ipad is mounted. So far so good. And I can see everything on the iPad. Cool. But why the fuck is it not possible to drag, let&#8217;s say, two or three apps and move them to iTunes? I don&#8217;t get it!</p>

<p>Noooooo - please right click the iPad in the left menu and choose &#8220;Transfer Purchases&#8221;. Apple - come on. Why are you doing such a lousy job? This is just the biggest bullshit I experienced with iTunes - beside the other bullshit with this software.</p>
