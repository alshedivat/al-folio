Up from [March 2014](http://blog.couchdb.org/2014/03/), we started to release the "CouchDB Weekly News". The reader will find all the interesting news about the development, community affairs, releases and much more of CouchDB and its community. It is an extremely helpful tool to spread the word about CouchDB. What we can say is, that the news are very well received and help the project to be more visible in the world.

The work of aggregating all interesting stuff is done by awesome [Lena](https://twitter.com/lrnrd). She is supported by the [Marketing Team](http://couchdb.apache.org/#mailing-lists) and the whole community. Thanks so much Lena for this awesome job.

We are always looking for contributors. If you are especially interested in communiyt-marketing stuff, please subscribe to the [marketing mailing-list](mailto:marketing-subscribe@couchdb.apache.org) and drop us a note.

And last, but not least: here are [the latest CouchDB News](http://blog.couchdb.org/2014/12/11/couchdb-weekly-news-december-11-2014/).
