I've been thinking about next monetization model after freemium models. Is it already here?

It is used by many NFT tools. Here's an example: [SuperSea](https://nonfungible.tools/supersea).

There are three tiers:
- free
- a subscription model
- a lifetime model using NFTs

Notice that the free and subscription model is already known - it's simply the "freemium" model. The additional tier of a lifetime membership is interesting as it combines the exclusive "country-club" status pricing model. Interestingly, this model might do a better job for companies to identify their "superfans" who are willing to pay a premium to get the lexclusive lifetime membership.

On the other hand, you can always pay the traditional subscription price * how long you intend to use the service. This would limit the price of a lifetime membership.

It's an interesting model and wonder if a company which offers a subscription model in their products to consider extending?
