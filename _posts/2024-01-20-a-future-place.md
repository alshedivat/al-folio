Well, it's the new year! While I'm a firm believer that change does not come on a calendar's schedule, I also love that this time of year is often accompanied by reflection and a deep (if not entirely warranted) optimism. In that spirit, I'm hoping that 2024 can be the year I return to writing, in both professional and poetic capacities. So consider this a very-visible placeholder in hopes that it will soon be replaced by some data thoughts - on visual design for data visualization, on feminist data ethics practices for analysts, on data culture work.

I'm looking forward to it. :smile:
