<p>Hi,</p>

<p>actually a user was looking for a database modeling tool at the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/community/lists/" target="_blank">postgresql mailinglist</a>. As I do use a piece of paper for my db modeling and having used <a href="http://fabforce.net/dbdesigner4/" target="_blank">DbDesigner</a> during my time using MySQL and Windows, I thought it would be a good chance to have a look at some tools. Actually two have been supposed by the list members.</p>

<p><strong>Power* Architect (thanks to Thomas Kellerer for the tip)</strong></p>

<p>This is a data modeling and profiling tool. It supports not just PostgreSQL but also many other DBMS. The connection to the database is handled by a JDBC driver. It&#8217;s avilable for MAC OS X, Windows and Linux and it&#8217;s open source (GPL v 3). <br/>
Here are some more features (copied from the page below):</p>

<p>- Connects to multiple source databases concurrently<br/>
- Compares data models &amp; database structures and identifies discrepancies<br/>
- Drag-and-drop source tables &amp; columns into the playpen<br/>
- Remembers the origin of each column<br/>
- Generates source-to-target visual Mapping Reports<br/>
- Forward-engineers to PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server &amp; more<br/>
- Saves source data structure snapshots in the project, so you can work remotely<br/>
- All project data is stored in an easy-to-parse XML format<br/>
- OLAP schema modeling: Cubes, Measures, Dimensions, Hierarchies &amp; Levels</p>

<p>Power* Architect is developed by a Canadian company called SQL Power. You can get more info and download at <a href="http://www.sqlpower.ca/page/architect" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.sqlpower.ca/page/architect" target="_blank">http://www.sqlpower.ca/page/architect</a></a></p>

<p><strong>MicroOLAP Database Designer for PostgreSQL (thanks to Pavel Golub for the tip)</strong></p>

<p>This is another one but unfortunately available only for Windows. As of this reason, I did not check it but it is said, that it has a good support for <a href="http://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">wine on Linux</a> OS. Here are some features (taken from the page below):</p>

<p>-simple physical database creation by using a wizard;<br/>
-Database structure generation;<br/>
-Database modification: generation of ALTER statements to bring a database to the state of the diagram;<br/>
-Reverse engineering (import) of existing databases from multiple sources;<br/>
-Export of a diagram to popular graphics formats;<br/>
-Database structure reports generation;<br/>
-Cheking a diagram for errors;<br/>

<p>This software is developed by a company called MicroOLAP. They have many other software concerning database.
