EVL PhD candidate Andrew Wentzel is recognized by the UIC College of Engineering for his extraordinary research with the annual Exceptional Research Promise Award.  The award recognizes PhD students who are within a year of graduating (i.e., have completed their prelim examination) and have demonstrated excellence in scholarship, academic publication, and other research-focused activities. Andrew&rsquo;s publication record during his doctoral studies so far is remarkable: 14 publications. He is the first author of six journal publications in top-tier venues, three in core visual computing venues, and three in clinical venues. He is the first author of two additional workshop papers in competitive venues (<30% acceptance rate), and a co-author and significant contributor of six other journal publications. Results from Andrew&rsquo;s work have been included in a 2023 European textbook in the visual computing field, and have been featured on the cover of the Journal of Imaging Science and Technology.<br><br>
