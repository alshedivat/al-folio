<p>Moin Moin,</p> <p>after taking part at the <a href="http://www.php-unconference.de/" target="_blank">PHP Unconference</a> this year in Hamburg and having a great time there, <a href="http://www.andresen.de" target="_blank">Judith Andresen</a> had the idea to initialize a <a href="http://www.intphpunconf.org/" target="_blank">International PHP Unconference</a>. I think this idea is just great. Not only german speaking PHP enthusiasts (and also people from other IT related areas), but also english speaking people will have the opportunity to attend to a real cool conference. The benefits are clear in my opinion:</p> <p>- affordable costs<br/>
- due to the self structured and&#8230;</p>
