The JSON data format has become a ubiquitous tool for interchanging and storing human-readable
data. In particular, it is very convenient when it comes to storing user-defined settings
and properties. For example, in rFaaS,
[our RDMA-accelerated serverless platform](/projects/rfaas), we have to store multi-parameter
device configurations for the local and remote endpoints.
Thus, we want to have the configuration in JSON as this format is flexible,
widely supported, and easy to parse for humans:

```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "name": "rocep7s0",
      "ip_address": "192.168.0.18",
      "port": 10005,
      "max_inline_data": 128,
      "default_receive_buffer_size": 32
    },
    {
      "name": "rocep6s0f0",
      "ip_address": "192.168.1.31",
      "port": 10000,
      "max_inline_data": 128,
      "default_receive_buffer_size": 32
    }
  ]
}
```

While JSON is natively supported in many languages, and even C++ has a multitude of
easy-to-use or high-performance JSON libraries, there's no native way of using JSONs in Bash scripts.
Bash syntax and capabilities are a bit ancient, but automated testing and benchmarking scripts could
benefit from using the same configuration format. Fortunately, there's an easy and lightweight
tool for that - [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). `jq` is a very simple querying tool that
allows reading and processing all complex and nested JSON structures. Below, I will present
a selection of queries in `jq` that demonstrate the basic usage and capabilities of this simple
yet powerful and useful tool.

The simplest query displays all JSON contents.

```shell
~ jq '.' configuration/devices.json
```

Selecting JSON object.

```shell
~ jq '.["devices"]' configuration/devices.json
[
  {
    "name": "rocep7s0",
    "ip_address": "192.168.0.18",
    "port": 10005,
    "max_inline_data": 128,
    "default_receive_buffer_size": 32
  },
  {
    "name": "rocep6s0f0",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.31",
    "port": 10000,
    "max_inline_data": 128,
    "default_receive_buffer_size": 32
  }
]
```

Selecting object in an array through direct indexing.

```shell
~ jq '.["devices"][0]' configuration/devices.json
{
  "name": "rocep7s0",
  "ip_address": "192.168.0.18",
  "port": 10005,
  "max_inline_data": 128,
  "default_receive_buffer_size": 32
}
```

Requesting a specific field in the object.

```shell
~ jq '.["devices"][0]["ip_address"]' configuration/devices.json
"192.168.0.18"
```

The quotation marks are usually not needed but we don't need `sed` or `tr` to remove them.

```shell
~ jq -r '.["devices"][0]["ip_address"]' configuration/devices.json
192.168.0.18
```

What if we want to access multiple fields with a single query?

```shell
~ jq -r '.["devices"][0] | .ip_address,.port' configuration/devices.json
192.168.0.18
10005
```

Unnecessary whitespace can be removed too.

```shell
~ jq -j '.["devices"][0] | .ip_address,.port' configuration/devices.json
192.168.0.1810005
```

However, this output is far from ideal. Instead, we might want to get a CSV-like or a semicolon-separated output.
We can use string interpolation for that.

```shell
~ jq -j '.["devices"][0] | "\(.ip_address);\(.port)"' configuration/devices.json
192.168.0.18;10005
```

Thus, we can process device addresses with this one-liner in Bash.

```shell
~ IFS=";" read ip port <<< $(jq -j '.["devices"][0] | "\(.ip_address);\(.port)"' configuration/devices.json)
~ echo $ip $port
192.168.0.18 10005
```

`jq` is not only about simple queries and text parsing.
The tool allows more complex operations, including finding an object with a specific value.
In our case, we want to find the address of a device with a given name, without knowing its position in the `devices` array:

```shell
~ jq -r '.devices[] | select(.name=="rocep7s0") | .ip_address' configuration/devices.json
192.168.0.18
```

More advanced queries are available in `jq`, including scripting with [`select`, `map`, and user-defined functions](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Advancedfeatures).
