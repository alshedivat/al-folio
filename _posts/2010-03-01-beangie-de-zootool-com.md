<p>Moin Moin,</p>

<p>today I just want to point out two real great websites.</p>

<h3>beangie.de</h3>

<p>I think it&#8217;s now nearly two years since I &#8220;found&#8221; Angela Becker in XING (or did she find me?). Funny as is, I stumbled upon her avatar. She was promted to change this avatar to a real foto by the XING team, but she&#8217;s still using it in twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/beangie" target="_blank">@beangie</a>). </p>

<p>I liked the avatar a lot because it was not the next stupid bourgoise foto of the girl or guy I don&#8217;t want to get in touch with. So I started some smalltalk and we realized, that we&#8217;re both living in Hamburg, like good rock music and have something to do with graphic. </p>

<p>As I am not a graphic or web designer, I am always looking for good people in this area. So the stuff she showed me was really cool and thankfully, she started to run her own business as a freelancer. But she had nothing to do with the web. Uh &#8230;. really? I did not care because I thought she can make it also.</p>

<p>Well I want to introduce you to her finally launched website where she&#8217;s presenting herself and some work she has done so far. I think it&#8217;s worth a look and maybe you need to get in touch with her because of a project you have. Working with her is totally productive and a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Btw. the great programming was done by her friend in love Stefan - follow him at twitter if you like: <a href="http://twitter.com/st_f_n" target="_blank">@st_f_n</a></p>

<p>Everybody needs a bookmark app to store bookmarks. Sure you can use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10868" target="_blank">Firefox Weave</a> to sync your bookmarks between different machines but I don&#8217;t like it that much (I mean bookmarks in the browser). Or you will use <a href="http://delicious.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://delicious.com/" target="_blank">http://delicious.com/</a></a> which is approved and well known. The API is also kind of cool because it&#8217;s RESTful in a way. But do you have nice thumbnails of the pages you bookmarked or a nice website with an overview? No!</p>

<p>It showed that following Dion Almaer in twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/dalmaer" target="_blank">@dalmaer</a>)is a good thing because he provided a link to <a href="http://zootool.com" target="_blank">Zootool</a>. Zootool is a web application (yes it really is) written by Bastian Allgeier (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/zootool" target="_blank">@zootool</a>) and is fuckin&#8217; awesome. This was exactly the piece of software I was looking for. It is webbased (what else?), the usability is great, it is looking super cool (like a Mac app ;-) ) and it behaves like a desktop application. </p>

<p>Zootool is using MooTools (a cool JavaScript library) heavily to get the desktop app feeling. I will meet Bastian in the middle of March in Mannheim. Maybe he&#8217;s telling me some more about the backend and the programming. And ZooTool is maybe one of the first real browser and webbased applications we can find &#8230;</p>

<p>After having some conversation with Bastian (the one like &#8220;ah your app is so super sexy bla bla bla&#8221; - &#8220;oh really thank you bla bla bla&#8221; :-) ) we found out, that he is living 15&#160;km away from the city where my parents still live and I was grown up till I was 24. Aha! That&#8217;s nice ;-). I am talking about Mannheim (Bastian) and Schwetzingen (me) in southern Germany.</p>
