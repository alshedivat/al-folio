description: Updated list of artists doing art by adversarial attacks. With examples!
tags: links images

Today I learned about Tom White (a.k.a. [dribnet](https://twitter.com/dribnet)) and his works on fooling vision systems with artisitc images. My [project on adversarial vandalism](/projects/adversarial_vandal/) was inspired by another work by Matty Mariansky on [Neurips Workshop](http://www.aiartonline.com/highlights-2020/matty-mariansky/). 

Since I now know two examples of adversarial attacks as an artistic instrument, I decided to make a list of them. Like the [AIArtists](https://aiartists.org/) but my own minimalistic one.
