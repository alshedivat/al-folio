The **depositar lab** researches and develops systems and tools for novel research data infrastructures and services. We operate the _[depositar](https://data.depositar.io/)_, an open research data repository, and curate the _[Research Data Management Hub (RDM Hub)](https://rdm.depositar.io/)_ for researchers of all disciplines in Taiwan and worldwide.
