The year 2023 is a special year. The world started to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Old friendships are rekindled and new connections have been made. Our blog, however, has not been updated as frequently as we would like. To celebrate the Labor Day of 2024, nevertheless we at [the depositar lab](https://lab.depositar.io/) take this occasion to summarize below our works from the previous year (2023-01 -- 2023-12).

### Hosted Projects and Datasets

+ Throughout 2023, a total of 463 public datasets were created or updated at least once at the [depositar](https://data.depositar.io), the research data repository we build and operate. Of those datasets, 348 were newly created datasets and 115 were updates to existing datasets. 

+ About 300 projects are now hosted at the depositar.

### System Upgrade and Enhancement

+ The [system](https://github.com/depositar/ckanext-data-depositario/) underlining the depositar (data.depositar.io) had been upgraded six times (from [v6.5.8](https://docs.depositar.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v6-5-8-2023-03-09) to [v6.6.2](https://docs.depositar.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v6-6-2-2023-10-26)).

+ [The Binder integration](https://binder.depositar.io/) of the depositar with JupyterHub (and more) has been completed. We present the [result](https://pid.depositar.io/ark:37281/k5s779b7d) at the DSWS-2023 conference in Tokyo in December.

### Writing on Research Data Management (RDM) 

+ Seven new articles appeared on the [RDM Hub](https://rdm.depositar.io/) website.
