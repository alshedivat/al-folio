Finally, the depositar team has a homepage! Being always busy with projects, writings, presentations, and collaborations with our partners, we did not make time to set up a website for the lab. But that all changes today. Please follow this website for news about the [_depositar_](https://data.depositar.io/en/about), updates to the projects we are working on, and more exciting things to come.

(Right, a few words here about how the site is built: This is a static site generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme.)
