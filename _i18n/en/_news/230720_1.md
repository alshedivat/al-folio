A few major research organiations have recently formulated or updated their data sharing policies. Data sharing is increasingly viewed as a responsibility of the global scientific community. In his article, titled "Making Data Sharing a Responsibility: On Recent Open Research Data Policies", Ming-Syuan Ho reviews the data sharing policies of the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as the challenges these policies may face. This article is simultaneously published in the [Research Data Management Hub (RDM Hub)](https://rdm.depositar.io/zh_TW/news/20220719-international-data-sharing-polices) and the [SciTech Report](https://www.scimonth.com.tw/archives/6512) in July.
