At the invitation of the organizers, we participated in the [Ecological Informatics Mini-Symposium](https://sites.google.com/view/ecological-informatics/) on June 11, 2023. Tyng-Ruey Chuang gave a 20-min talk on _[Thoughts on Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) Data Management and Preservation](https://m.odw.tw/u/trc/m/ltser-data-strategy/)_. Materials in some part of the presentation slides come from [a blog post by Paopei Huang at the Research Data Management Hub](https://rdm.depositar.io/resources/20221007-LTSER-data-managment-principles).
