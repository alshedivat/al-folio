In January, the depositar lab visited the [Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Ecology and Sustainability (CIRES)](https://www.cires-taiwan.org/) at the National Dong Hwa University to exchange ideas and practices on research data management (RDM). Paopei Huang wrote a report about the visit. This article, which is in Chinese, is now online at [RDM Hub (研究資料管理推進室)](https://rdm.depositar.io/showcases/20230427-CIRES-depositar-communication) and will be published by [_SciTech Report_ (科技報導)](https://www.scimonth.com.tw/archives/6388) in May. The slides used in the meeting have been collected into a dataset: [ark:37281/k5v7d5f9c](https://pid.depositar.io/ark:37281/k5v7d5f9c).
