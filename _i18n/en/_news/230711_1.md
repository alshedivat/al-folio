This year the depositar lab welcomes eight summer internship students! As part of the training, we will hold short courses for the interns on [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), [QField](https://qfield.org/), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), and [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org): 

| Course        | Instructor         | Date & Time                | 
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- | 
| QGIS          | Hsiung-Ming Liao   | July 18, 2:00pm -- 4:30pm  | 
| QField        | Yu-Huang Wang      | July 20, 10:00am - 12:30pm | 
| OpenStreetMap | Dennis Raylin Chen | July 26, 10:00am - 12:30pm | 
| Wikidata      | Tyng-Ruey Chuang   | July 27, 10:00am - 12:30pm | 

By giving these short courses, we hope to introduce the students to the use and enrichment of these communal resources of open geographic information and structured data. The courses will be held in room N107 at the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, and conducted in Taiwanese Mandarin.

We thank Hsiung-Ming Liao (GIS Center, RCHSS, Academia Sinica), Yu-Huang Wang (Nature Watch Ecological and Environmental Consultancy), and Dennis Raylin Chen (Wikimedia Taiwan) for teaching the courses.

This year the summer internship students are from the CCU, NTNU, NTU, NYCU, and Yunlin Tech in Taiwan, and from Georgia Tech and Texas A&M in the US.
