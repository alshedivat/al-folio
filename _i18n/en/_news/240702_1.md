We welcome five intern students to the depositar lab this summer! As part of the internship training, we organize short courses on [Research Data Management (RDM)](https://rdm.depositar.io/), structured text, git, and Jupyter Book ([see last year's intern projects](https://lab.depositar.io/zh-tw/news/240304_1/)), [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org), and 360° photo/video documentation and processing:

By giving these short courses, we hope to introduce the students to the basics of research data management and static website generation, as well as to the use and enrichment of communal resources of open geographic information and structured data. The courses will be held at the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, and conducted in Taiwanese Mandarin. After taking these courses, the interns will work on personal projects. 

We are especially grateful to our guest lecturers: Hsiung-Ming Liao (GIS Center, RCHSS, Academia Sinica), Yu-Huang Wang (Nature Watch Ecological and Environmental Consultancy), and Dennis Raylin Chen (Wikimedia Taiwan).

This year the summer internship students are from the National Cheng Kung University, the National Chung Cheng University, and the National Dong Hwa University in Taiwan, and from Vassar College in New York, USA.
