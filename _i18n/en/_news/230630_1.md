Invited by the [Foundation of Historic City Conservation and Regeneration](http://www.fhccr.org.tw/), we participated in the ["Taiwan's 400th anniversary, and then?"](https://artouch.com/art-views/cultural-policy/content-110719.html) forum on June 4, 2023. Tyng-Ruey Chuang gave a 20-min talk on [_Open Repositories for Landscape Documentations_](https://m.odw.tw/u/trc/m/tainan-400-talk/). The slides for the talk were modified from those that were previously used in the [2021 Workshop on Cultural and Natural Landscape Documentation](https://pid.depositar.io/ark:37281/k5z9s6309).
