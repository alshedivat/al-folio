Course Description:

> Digital linguistic corpora, i.e. electronic collections of written, spoken or multimodal language data, have become an increasingly important source of empirical information for theoretical and applied linguistics in recent years. This course is meant as a theoretically founded, practical introduction to corpus work with a broad selection of data, including non-standardized varieties such as language on the Internet, learner corpora and historical corpora. We will discuss issues of corpus design, annotation and evaluation using quantitative methods and both manual and automatic annotation tools for different levels of linguistic analysis, from parts-of-speech, through syntax to discourse annotation.

As a TA, I helped students with difficult linguistic annotations, as well as grading and correcting their work. The results became part of the [Georgetown University Multilayer (GUM) corpus](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gum/).
