      # description:
      #   - Designed an efficient, novel public-key functional encryption scheme for specific functionality in the static collusion bound model whose time complexity and size of the ciphertexts are linear in the static query bound.
      #   - Designed a new, efficient unbounded-collusion private-key functional encryption for the same functionality.
      #   - Currently optimizing the private-key functional encryption scheme using secure multi-party computation.
      #   - Implementing the public and private key FE schemes using optimal blocks for efficient execution in C/C++.
      #   - Surveyed FHE based Private Machine Learning protocols and the feasibility of optimal FE-based solutions.
      #   - A paper based on the work will be published soon at an undecided conference. Work to be included as part of master's dissertation.
