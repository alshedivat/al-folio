    - title: "The Gorky Literary Institute: Creative Writing under Socialism"
      description: This project examines questions of mutual influence among formalized education, creative processes, and literary evolution in the socialist world. By analyzing the educational activities of the Gorky Literary Institute (1933-) which produced (or sometimes failed to produce) socialist writers, this project shows how socialist creative writing institutions impacted the formation of the transnational “Soviet Republic of Letters.”
