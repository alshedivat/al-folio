    Amit is looking at the random dynamics of interacting colloidal particles
    to see what we can learn about their interactions from their kinematics. 
    This work is in collaboration with [Roy Beck's lab](https://www.becklab.sites.tau.ac.il/).

   Shachaf is looking at a geometrical description of soft mechanical meta-materials. 
   He's using  [our recently developed formalism](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1920237117), 
   to study disordered metamaterials and understand emergent phenomena such as the collapse
   dynamics, localization properties and more.

   Yamin is working on incorporating our [Neural-based method for calculating entropy](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2017042117) 
   into molecular dynamics simulations. The aim is to use neurally-estimated entropy as a collective variable in MD simulations
   that would allow effective sampling of entropically stabilized phases. Yamin is co-advised by [Dr. Barak Hirshberg](https://hirshberg-group.webflow.io/) from the school of Chemistry.
