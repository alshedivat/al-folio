DAIMSL focuses on **safely and effectively operating robots in self-driving laboratories**, utilizing **immersive environments** and **digital twin (DT) technologies**. The goal is to develop general interfaces for applying immersive and DT technologies across various laboratory processes, addressing a challenge not yet fully met by current bespoke systems.

The key objectives include establishing best practices for integrating **augmented and virtual reality (A/VR)** with robotic systems and their DTs, tackling issues such as **resolution, representation, latency, safety, and usability**. This will enhance our understanding of A/VR capabilities and limitations and lead to advancing the implementation of DT technologies in scientific robotics, and providing critical insights for educational and research applications.

A **Digital Twin** serves as a dynamic virtual model of a physical system, enabling a bidirectional data flow that supports simulations and real-time adjustments based on predictive analytics and user inputs. The project also focuses on designing and evaluating methods for **DT data handling**, which are crucial for optimizing laboratory processes and identifying potential risks.

**AI model training** involves data collected from human-operated lab tasks, with an emphasis on using transfer-learning to efficiently adapt pre-trained models to new tasks. Initial experiments are conducted in Argonne’s rapid prototyping lab, using an A/VR interface for simple chemistry tasks to ensure adherence to critical safety and experimental protocols.

As **DOE laboratories increasingly adopt AI and robotics**, this research is essential for enhancing the safety, quality, and efficiency of laboratory operations through advanced A/VR and DT technologies. The project delivers vital tools, methods, and insights for the future of automated and self-driving labs.

<!--**We are looking to hire both graduate and undergraduate students for this effort.** -->
