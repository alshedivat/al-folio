I made a Tesla Coil Model in my high school. I got shocked twice by electricity! ⚡️🤯⚡️ Fortunately I survived. As president of a school club, I used this Tesla coil model along with an Iron Man Arc reactor model to create a promotional video for the club. The video featured me getting (safely) shocked by the Tesla coil as an eye-catching demonstration. Though nerve-wracking, it made for an impactful video that represented our technology club's spirit of innovation despite risks. The Iron Man suit also made a memorable appearance alongside the spark-emitting coils. Overall, this exciting video project let me bring together my interests in technology, science fiction, and creative media.
