The mining of software repositories helped create large-scale research works in code comprehension,
statistics, developer preferences and behavior, and the effectiveness of modern programming languages. 
However, this work has not targeted C++ as often as it did focus on other languages, primarily
due to the difficulty of automatic C++ source code building.
In this research project, we developed a semi-automatic system for building open source C++ 
projects, and we are working on analyzing GitHub repositories.

How does the world of C++ truly look like?
How did the open-source community incorporate new language standards?
Which language features and standard library components are used frequently, and which are not?
How do C++ programmers express parallelism?
How effective are compiler static analysis passes and optimizations?
