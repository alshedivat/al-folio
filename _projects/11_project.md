## üî¨ Foundation Models in Computational Pathology

**Challenge**: Foundation models in computational pathology are typically trained at a fixed magnification. How does their performance change when applied to whole-slide images at different resolutions?

**My Solution**: I systematically evaluated the robustness of the UNI foundation model across multiple magnifications using three breast histology datasets (BACH, BRACS, and BreakHis).

### üéØ **Key Findings**

- **Resolution Matters**: While UNI maintains performance across different resolutions, magnification shifts influence feature quality and classification outcomes.
- **Gated Attention Helps**: Gated attention and non-linear heads improve consistency, guiding the development of more adaptable digital pathology pipelines.

### üî¨ **Research Contributions**

- **Systematic Evaluation**: Conducted the first systematic evaluation of a foundation model's robustness to resolution changes in computational pathology.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Implemented a preprocessing pipeline to generate and validate tiles across varying magnification levels.
- **Ablation Studies**: Performed extensive ablation studies to understand the impact of magnification levels, aggregation strategies, and model architectures.
