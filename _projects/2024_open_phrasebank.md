## Open Phrasebank

[The repository](https://github.com/liuh886/GEO4300_2023/) provides an accessible **phrase bank**, which is a collection of frequently used phrases that can be utilized, for example, in the auto-complete function of an IDE, to help non-native speakers write more fluently. The phrase bank is based on the analysis of the phrases used in scientific articles (or any text you are interested), so it can also used for word visualization. The repository is open for contributions, and the authors encourage users to contribute to the phrase bank by submitting pull requests.

You can further customize the phrasebank according to your needs, e.g. for certain disciplines, for certain styles (descriptive, analytical, persuasive and critical), for certain sections (abstract, body text), as long as you can find good ingredients.
