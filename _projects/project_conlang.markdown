While I've dabbled in creating a few different constructed languages, my favorite is 💭🗣🔣😀, which uses emoji as its primary modality. I've translated sentences suggested by my fellow Twitter linguists into this language and invited them to figure out as much as they can about the grammar--if this sounds like a fun puzzle to you too, see the tweet thread below!
