As our contribution to the 2020 Global Game Jam with the motto "Repair", we created a platform fighting with the name "Body Part Fighter". A mad scientist has found a passion in "repairing" dead bodies of various creatures and letting them fight against each other. It was created in 48 hours and can be downloaded on the official [GGJ website](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/body-part-fighter-5).
