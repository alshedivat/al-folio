        As our contribution to the 2019 Global Game Jam with the motto "What home means to you", we created a 2D platformer with the name "Mu". A triangle discovers its meaning of home: friendship. It can be downloaded on the official [GGJ website](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2019/games/mu-0).

Originally, the game was intended to be just about saving your friend. During the game jam, we copied the player triangle, changed the color and thought we created a static friend. Accidentally, the triangle friend had the control script still attached and moved along with the player triangle. We decided to keep it that way and made it a mechanic by designing platforms, that can only be solved together.
