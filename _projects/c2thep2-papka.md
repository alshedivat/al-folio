Northern Illinois University (NIU) and the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), in partnership with Argonne and Fermilab, administer **C² the P²**, a two-year computational traineeship in high energy physics. Students complete their core graduate curricula while taking dedicated computational physics courses, participating in a **monthly seminar series**, **annual retreats**, and gaining hands-on experience via lab collaborations. The program offers a **tuition waiver**, **competitive stipend**, and **travel support** to enable immersive training in computational HEP.
