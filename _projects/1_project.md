PySM 3 is developed on Github at <https://github.com/galsci/pysm>.

It is a large rewrite of the original PySM 2 code by Ben Thorne, David Alonso, Sigurd Naess, Jo Dunkley, focused on reducing memory usage, improving performance and run in parallel with MPI.

After having completed the performance-focused optimizations, we are now implementing brand new Galactic emission models based on the latest available data and scientific understanding.

If you are interested in implementing a new model into PySM 3, reporting a bug, or requesting a new feature, please [open an issue in the repository](https://github.com/galsci/pysm/issues).
