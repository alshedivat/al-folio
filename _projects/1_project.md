    Regenerating forest in interior British Columbia

My PhD work looks at structural forest regeneration following stand-replacing disturbances in interior British Columbia. In this work I use lidar derived forest structure to correlate to spectral measurements from satellite metrics. I capitilize on the rapid expansion of lidar technology, namely the DJI Zenmuse L1 (pictured below) to develop structural metrics. For satellite metrics, I look at annual and seasonal composites to understand when a disturbance occured and the spectral trajectory since the disturbance.
