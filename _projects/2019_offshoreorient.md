`OffshoreOrient Studio` (OOS) is an offshore seismic QC toolbox, a good friend for lazy seismic QC/GEO/NAV/Client. This is my independent work that has been tested and used by my colleagues for several years. Sadly, I will not update it anymore. The OOS had applied for software copyright (Registration No. 5073387) under the National Copyright Administration.

In OffshoreOrient Studio v1.0.3 toolbox, _NavPy_ focuses on the shot-by-shot** or sequence-by-sequence QC**. *QcPy* is mainly used for **Trace edit** and **RMS analysis**. *SourcePy* is a **real-time solution for near-field Gun QC**.

## NavPy: the truth from data

- SurveyWide map: for spatial analysis and statistics. Not just a static map.
- SurveyWide chart: for line-by-line QC. Does barnacle growing affect WSP?
- P1 Navigator: for p190 files format check and transformation.
- CSV Navigator: for shot-by-shot QC.
- STS Navigator: for .sts files extraction.Wide-tow modeling: How do the wide-towed sources work?

## QcPy: a click QC, seimic lazily

QcPy could be used for RMS analysis, noise test, sensitivity normalization, and trace edit, Fresnel chart

- Trace Edit toolkits: P2G (Promax to GeoEast) / ADS Pro/ Trace Edit Plot. 
- RMS analysis:  RMS analysis, Noise test, Sensitivity Normalization
- Fresnel Calculation: for estimating the size of the Fresnel zone, and gaining a more flexible binning strategy.

## SourcePy: Real time shooting QC

SourcePy is checking header files by Gun Controller in real time. You can self-define an alarm policy to save your eyes from the screen.
