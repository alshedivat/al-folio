People want to make better decisions, and to do that, they need better ways to think and collaborate. However, in todayâ€™s information-saturated world, the sheer volume and complexity of data can overwhelm even the best teams. Sorting through vast amounts of information, developing and sharing innovative ideas effectively, and reaching well-informed decisions quickly are challenges that traditional tools struggle to address.

SAGE3 tackles these challenges head-on by transforming how groups collaborate. As an open-source platform backed by over 20 years of National Science Foundation funded research [1,4], SAGE3 is designed to help teams make sense of complex information and work together more effectively. By seamlessly complementing with tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet, and now integrating Artificial Intelligence, SAGE3 creates a unified environment where information and ideas can flow freely.

With real-time information sharing, AI and visualization capabilities, SAGE3 provides a dynamic platform for collaboration across laptops, meeting room projectors, and large tiled display walls- enabling teams to think more clearly, ideate more creatively, and reach decisions faster and with greater confidence.
