Groups have the potential to outperform the cognitive capabilities of individuals, making better decisions with less information. This phenomenon, collective wisdom, is widespread in animal socieities and is a primary benefit of group living. However, it is not an instrinsic property of any group and depends on how individuals interact and share information. For animals, these actions and interactions are shaped by natural selection to produce collectively wise choices.

With the advent of social media, we now have the ability to alter how we interact and share information with likely consequences for collective wisdom. If we do so prudently, we can promote wise and misinformation-robust societies. Unfortunately, our current approach is to organize society around engagement and ad sales.

A portion of my research focuses on understanding the conditions that promote collective wisdom over folly and how it can be improved through platform design. This work ranges from purely theoretical studies on how spatial and temporal correlations impact wisdom to empirical work on the consequences of polarization and interventions to reduce misinformation online.
