Team from Robotics Club, IOE Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University participates in the annual international robotic competion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon">ABU Robocon.</a>. During Year 2019 the competiton was held in Ulaanbaatar Mongolia.

I have been actively involved in constructing the robots according to the theme of year 2019. We were required to construct two robots. We designed, fabricated and tested the control mechanism of robots. I mainly worked on MR1 Robot. Various techniques such as Kalman Filter for sensor fusion, PID Control system, Inverse Kinematics, path planning algorithms were used to achieved the designated task according to the theme of competition. With limited resource constructing a robot within time constraint was indeed a challenge. This opportunity did enhance my creative thinking and problem solving skill along with time management. 

<b>Team Nepal was honored by Rohm Award during the competition.</b>
