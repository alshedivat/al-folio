In the age of a pandemic, the need for a robust and functioning medical system cannot be  overstated. While COVID-19 continues to present the largest challenge to the American medical  system in recent history at the time of writing, it also presents a novel opportunity to begin thinking  about improvements that can be made to operating procedures and the way in which individuals  pay for prescription drug treatments. Pandemic notwithstanding, the U.S. has seen precipitous 
yearly increases in prescription drug prices – a trend that is projected to continue into the future. 


We begin by looking at the overall U.S. healthcare industry to study the macro-economics,  industry trends and areas of focus. This is done by comparing and contrasting the U.S. healthcare  system with other nations. Then, we strive to build an understanding of our project sponsor  Cayuga Health Partners (CHP) – its organizational structure, corporate goals, and operating  policies and procedures – to offer affordable, high-quality care to its patient population. Next, we  look at the different flow of funds and services in the U.S. healthcare network – to identify key  stakeholders, their roles and the value creation process – to hone in on our project’s area of focus  of prescription drug spending. Lastly, we zoom into the U.S. Pharmaceutical Retail Distribution  system – to identify major players, their market share and the value creation process – to  corroborate our focus on CHP’ prescribing practices. Using the flow of a hypothetical $100  expenditure on prescription drugs covered under private insurance, we explore the expense-share  captured by each echelon in the pharmacy distribution network. This underscores the rationale of  our data analysis and the significance that our client’s prescribing practices have on patients’ insurance claims (or specifically out-of-pocket expenses, for example).
