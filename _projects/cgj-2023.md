Our team participated in a 48-hour game design and development activity (CiGA Game Jam) in 2023 with the theme "TOUCH." We created a 2D puzzle game focused on brain training. Our team consisted of two game designers, including myself, and three programmers. I was thrilled to brainstorm creative ideas related to "TOUCH" with my team. We ultimately decided to make a 2D brain training game within the 48-hour timeframe.

You can play our game at https://gmhub.com/game/2733 and provide feedback. This game jam exposed me to many impressive games that sparked inspiration. I hope you have as much fun playing the games as we did making them! Please check out the other creative entries when you have a chance :)
