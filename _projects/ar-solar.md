The AR Body-sensing Solar System was developed using Unity and Kinect to enhance children's interest and joy in learning Astronomy. It recognizes up to five human bodies and overlays planet models on the right hands, allowing for an interactive and engaging experience compared to traditional static images and text. This system was demonstrated at a science popularization event targeted towards children in K12. Multiple users could interact with it simultaneously, reducing waiting times. The children were eager to try the exhibit and intuitively knew how to engage with it as soon as they entered the activity area. This type of interactive, body-driven exhibit shows promise for increasing engagement and learning in STEM topics.
