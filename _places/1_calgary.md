With about 30% of the city's population being born outside Canada and 140 spoken languages, no matter where you call home you are sure to find a piece of it here. The relatively low-cost of living, multi-cultural and diverse population, and quality of life are amongst the reasons Calgary is one of the [most popular destinations for new Canadians to settle in](https://canadianvisa.org/blog/cities-and-places/top-10-most-multicultural-cities-to-settle-in-canada). Alberta is famous for its big blue skies and Calgary is the sunniest major Canadian city with 333 days of sunshine on average per year, but with four distinct seasons, and [Chinook winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_wind) raising temperatures by +30C within a few hours, the weather is never boring!

Calgary is served by an public transit system consisting of two light-rail lines (C-Trains), with one more under construction, and an extensive bus network. The University of Calgary is on the Red C-Train line, and thus easily accessible from anywhere along the line.
