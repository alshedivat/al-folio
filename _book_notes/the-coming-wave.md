Main thesis
- Upcoming waves of technologies (AI and gene editing) will destabilize societies and nation-states to the point where chaotic failed states or dystopian surveillance states become the likely default outcomes
- Constraining technology so that it continues to do far more good than bad (containment) seems almost impossible: it needs to happen in every lab and company in every country forever despite overwhelming incentives to the contrary, but it remains indispensable. 
- This makes it the greatest challenge of the coming decades, likely even more pressing and much less appreciated than global warming.

Coming wave technologies
- **Synthetic intelligence**: machine learning
- **Synthetic biology/life**: gene editing and synthesis
- Support technologies: robotics, quantum computing, fusion energy

Coming wave technology characteristics that make containment difficult
- **Asymmetric impact**: risks (like upsides) created by small teams extend to entire societies (engineered pandemic, disinformation campaign) - just like a single person can now broadcast globally (through the information wave with Internet and social media), a single person will be able to act globally
- **Extremely fast evolution** (at the pace of software)
- **General purpose**
- **Autonomy**: potential beyond use as tools (AI that chooses its own goals, gene editing that starts a new species)

Incentives against containment
- **Geopolitical competition** among leading nation states: the attitude of behaving like adversaries are engaged in an arms race (commonplace in governments and think tanks) is a self fulfilling prophecy (classic prisoner’s dilemma) - started with AlphaGo in China
- **Global research ecosystem valuing curiosity and openness**, operating through evidence-based open peer review (arXiv, GitHub) - openness is not just to enable falsifiability/criticism in Science but also for prestige and as a track record for researchers
- **Financial upsides**: unbounded possible upsides lead to huge investments from big tech and VCs
- **Need to address global challenges of this century**: global warming, care for aging population and its replacement in the workforce
- **Ego**: making history, beating others, impressing others

The coming wave can be characterized by the broad availability of power
  - Power is the ability to affect the world towards goals (including the behavior of others)
  - Technology has always been a major (the most important?) source of power, but this wave
      - Will bring **more power than any prior technology**: an army of the world’s best experts on any subject with the ability to autonomously take action towards your goals
      - **More broadly accessible than ever before**: everyone with a smartphone and Internet - the same will apply to physical power (robots) with the falling cost of hardware

This will place a huge stress on societies and nation states
- **Unprecedented pressure on the nation states** to provide security, stability, and public services against **empowered bad actors**: in the short term, disinformation campaigns through synthetic media; in the long term, pretty much anything is possible
- Even ignoring bad actors, the simple widespread presence of such powerful technologies can have unintended disastrous consequences (lab leak)
- **Labor market disruptions**: in the short term, AI will automate large portions of today’s jobs, both intellectual and physical, leading to underemployed, insecure, and angry populations
- **Concentration of power for corporations**: the best will enjoy compounding returns on intelligence (use ⇒ data + deployment experience + attract best engineers ⇒ better product ⇒ more use) and challenge nation states - this coincidence of centralizing and decentralizing forces was already a feature of the Internet

It will likely lead to a **tightening of the nation state’s grip on power**: unprecedented levels of surveillance in the name of security
- This is made much easier than ever before through AI as China is already showing today
- If this seems unimaginable, think of Covid lockdowns

The alternative path of **trying to stop technological evolution**, even if it were possible (it doesn’t seem to be), **is not a viable option**
- Our modern societies are predicated on constant growth, only possible through technological progress
- We simply cannot deal with this century’s problems (global warming, aging population) without new Science and technology - maintaining, let alone improving, standards of living needs technology
- Static societies are bound to collapse, unable to invent their way out of problems

What can we do about this? 10 ideas for containment, concentric circles of guardrails around technology
- **Technical safety**: isolate systems from the world and ensure we maintain control - a proportion (say 20%) of research from leading organizations should be mandatorily dedicated to safety research and share findings
- **Transparency and accountability**: build trust by proving safety and being accountable to governments and cross-organization institutions thar track failures, KYC requirements on APIs, screening of all synthesized DNA, cryptographic tracking of model sharing, verification enforced through code backdoor by authorities
- **Choke points**: Nvidia makes all chips, all manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan, with equipment from ASML in the Netherlands; the AI frontier is a handful of industrial labs - use choke points to slow down progress and get more time to operationalize containment
- **Builder responsibility**: front line technology builders have a responsibility - more than anyone else, although we need diverse perspectives - to be critics and remember that technology is just a means to an end
- **Company responsibility**: shareholder returns as a company’s goal is poorly suited to containment, we need to reconcile profits and social purpose in company legal structures - this will be difficult: shareholder capitalism works because it is simple and clear
- **Government governance**
    - Governments should understand what data their population generates and the latest research to leverage AI - to make this possible, they should have in-house world class researchers and engineers (with compensation aligned with the private sector)
    - They should log all ways technology causes harm
    - Frontier AI labs and models should be licensed after a certain threshold of capabilities
    - Fiscal policy is crucial to avoid extreme concentration of power in the hands of mega corporations and fund public services in an era of increasing state fragility: greater tax on older forms of capital, new tax on automation systems
- **International cooperation**: new global institutions starting with a focus on transparency and accountability
- **A self-critical culture of openness in sharing failures** to learn together (like the aviation industry) instead of today’s culture of secrecy about failures
- **Popular buy in**: large change requires the average person to care and demand change (abolition of slavery, women vote, civil rights, global warming)
- **Coherence**: containment is an emergent phenomenon of the interaction between all guardrails, safety is not a destination but an ongoing dynamic and unstable process, a narrow and never ending path
