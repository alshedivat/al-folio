Classical applications of community detection have largely focused on unipartite networks - i.e., graphs built out of a single type of objects. However, due to increased availability of biological data from various sources, there is now an increasing need for handling heterogeneous networks which are built out of multiple types of objects. In this paper, we address the problem of identifying communities from biological bipartite networks - i.e., networks where interactions are observed between two different types of objects (e.g., genes and diseases, drugs and protein complexes, plants and pollinators, and hosts and pathogens). Toward detecting communities in such bipartite networks, we make the following contributions: i) (metric) we propose a variant of bipartite modularity; ii) (algorithms) we present an efficient algorithm called biLouvain that implements a set of heuristics toward fast and precise community detection in bipartite networks (https://github.com/paolapesantez/biLouvain); and iii) (experiments) we present a thorough experimental evaluation of our algorithm including comparison to other state-of-the-art methods to identify communities in bipartite networks. Experimental results show that our biLouvain algorithm identifies communities that have a comparable or better quality (as measured by bipartite modularity) than existing methods, while significantly reducing the time-to-solution between one and four orders of magnitude.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="granell_scoping_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A scoping review on the use, processing and fusion of geographic data in virtual assistants</div> <div class="author"> Carlos Granell, Paola G.

Many disciplines in science are moving towards the incorporation of intelligent virtual assistants in multiple scenarios and application domains, and GIScience is not external to this trend since they may be connected to intelligent spatial decision support systems. This article presents a scoping review to indicate relevant literature pertinent to intelligent virtual assistants and their usage of geospatial information and technologies. In particular, the study was designed to find critical aspects of GIScience and how to contribute to the development of virtual assistants. Moreover, this work explores the most prominent research lines as well as relevant technologies/platforms to determine the main challenges and current limitations regarding the use and implementation of virtual assistants in geospatial-related fields. As a result, this review shows the current state of geospatial applications regarding the use of intelligent virtual assistants, as well as revealing gaps and limitations in the use of spatial methods, standards, and resources available in spatial data infrastructures to develop intelligent decision systems based on virtual assistants for a wide array of application domains.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="pesantez-cabrera_towards_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Towards an evaluation method of how accessible serious games are to older adults</div> <div class="author"> Paola Pesántez-Cabrera, María Inés Acosta, Verónica Jimbo, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

In this context, serious games have become a tool that supports health professionals in mitigating age-related cognitive problems. Additionally, the accessibility provided by those tools is a determinant factor when users need to adapt themselves to a particular technology. Therefore, this paper presents an accessibility model and an evaluation method useful for assessing how accessible serious games are to older adults, based on the Games Accessibility Guidelines (GAG) proposed by the International Game Developers Association and the ISO/IEC 25040. In order to validate and ensure the feasibility of this study, each activity of the proposed method has been applied to a real game that was created for improving certain cognitive functions (i.e., A Clockwork Brain suite of serious games).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="hilliger_towards_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Towards learning analytics adoption: A mixed methods study of data-related practices and policies in Latin American universities</div> <div class="author"> Isabel Hilliger, Margarita Ortiz-Rojas, Paola Pesántez-Cabrera, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 7 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '7 more authors' ?

Although universities have been collecting educational data for years, the adoption of LA in this region is still limited due to the lack of expertise and policies for processing and using educational data. In order to get a better picture of how existing data-related practices and policies might affect the incorporation of LA in Latin American institutions, we conducted a mixed methods study in four Latin American universities (two Chilean and two Ecuadorian). In this paper, the qualitative data were based on 37 interviews with managers and 16 focus groups with 51 teaching staff and 45 students; the quantitative data were collected through two surveys answered by 1884 students and 368 teachers, respectively. The findings reveal opportunities to incorporate LA services into existing data practices in the four case studies. However, the lack of reliable information systems and policies to regulate the use of data imposes challenges that need to be overcome for future LA adoption.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="hilliger_assessing_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Assessing Institutional Needs for Learning Analytics Adoption in Latin American Higher Education</div> <div class="author"> Isabel Hilliger, Mar Pérez-Sanagustín, Margarita Ortiz, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 7 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '7 more authors' ?

So far, most studies in LA have concentrated on the development of tools to address educational challenges in the contexts of Europe, Australia, and U.S. However, tools and adoption frameworks developed in these contexts are not necessarily applicable for higher education institutions in the rest of the world. Given that there is no one-size-fits-all approach, this study aims to assess institutional needs for LA in the Latin American context by collecting and analyzing qualitative information obtained from managers, teaching staff and students at four universities (U1, U2, U3, and U4). Although most participants agreed that LA is a promising means to monitor students’ academic progress at a curriculum level, findings show specific needs and considerations that differentiate each university (U1: academic support for subgroups, U2: dropout indicators,</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="saxena_grape_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Grape Cold Hardiness Prediction via Multi-Task Learning</div> <div class="author"> Aseem Saxena, Paola Pesantez-Cabrera, Rohan Ballapragada, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

To help prevent these losses, farmers deploy expensive frost mitigation measures, such as, sprinklers, heaters, and wind machines, when they judge that damage may occur. This judgment, however, is challenging because the cold hardiness of plants changes throughout the dormancy period and it is difficult to directly measure. This has led scientists to develop cold hardiness prediction models that can be tuned to different grape cultivars based on laborious field measurement data. In this paper, we study whether deep-learning models can improve cold hardiness prediction for grapes based on data that has been collected over a 30-year time period. A key challenge is that the amount of data per cultivar is highly variable, with some cultivars having only a small amount. For this purpose, we investigate the use of multi-task learning to leverage data across cultivars in order to improve prediction performance for individual cultivars. We evaluate a number of multi-task learning approaches and show that the highest performing approach is able to significantly improve over learning for single cultivars and outperforms the current state-of-the-art scientific model for most cultivars.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="pesantez-cabrera_kinetic_2016" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Kinetic Model of Development and Aging of Artificial Skin Based on Analysis of Microscopy Data</div> <div class="author"> Paola Pesantez-Cabrera, Cläre von Neubeck, Marianne B.

In this chapter, we show how modeling can integrate microscopy data to obtain a better understanding of the development and aging of artificial human skin. We use the time-dependent structural information predicted by our model to show how irradiation with an electron beam at different times in the life of artificial human skin affects the amount of energy deposited in different layers of the tissue. Experimental studies of this type will enable a better understanding of how different cell types in human skin contribute to overall tissue response to ionizing radiation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%79%6F%75@%65%78%61%6D%70%6C%65.%63%6F%6D" title="email"><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="/al-folio/feed.xml" title="RSS Feed"><i class="fas fa-rss-square"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note"> You can even add a little note about which of these is the best way to reach you. </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2022 Paola Pesantez-Cabrera.
