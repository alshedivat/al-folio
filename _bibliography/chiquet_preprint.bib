  abstract = {Most popular dimension reduction (DR) methods like t-SNE and UMAP are based on minimizing a cost between input and latent pairwise similarities. Though widely used, these approaches lack clear probabilistic foundations to enable a full understanding of their properties and limitations. To that extent, we introduce a unifying statistical framework based on the coupling of hidden graphs using cross entropy. These graphs induce a Markov random field dependency structure among the observations in both input and latent spaces. We show that existing pairwise similarity DR methods can be retrieved from our framework with particular choices of priors for the graphs. Moreover this reveals that these methods suffer from a statistical deficiency that explains poor performances in conserving coarse-grain dependencies. Our model is leveraged and extended to address this issue while new links are drawn with Laplacian eigenmaps and PCA.}

	abstract = {Interactions between plant pathogens and other plant-associated microorganisms regulate disease. Deciphering the networks formed by these interactions, termed pathobiomes, is crucial to disease management. Our aim was to investigate whether microbial association networks inferred from metabarcoding data give relevant insights into pathobiomes, by testing whether inferred associations contain signals of ecological interactions. We used Poisson Lognormal Models to construct microbial association networks from metabarcoding data and then investigated whether some of these associations corresponded to interactions measurable in co-cultures or known in the literature, by using grapevine (Vitis vinifera) and the fungal pathogen causing powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator) as a model system. Our model suggested that the pathogen species was associated with 23 other fungal species, forming its putative pathobiome. These associations were not known as interactions in the literature, but one of them was confirmed by our co-culture experiments. The yeast Buckleyzyma aurantiaca impeded pathogen growth and reproduction, in line with the negative association found in the microbial network. Co-cultures also supported another association involving two yeast species. Together, these findings indicate that microbial networks can provide plausible hypotheses of ecological interactions that could be used to develop microbiome-based strategies for crop protection.}
