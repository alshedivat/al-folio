  title={SCORE: approximating curvature information under self-concordant regularization},
  author={Adeoye, A. D. and Bemporad, A.},
  abstract={Optimization problems that include regularization functions in their objectives are regularly solved in many applications. When one seeks second-order methods for such problems, it may be desirable to exploit specific properties of some of these regularization functions when accounting for curvature information in the solution steps to speed up convergence. In this paper, we propose the SCORE (self-concordant regularization) framework for unconstrained minimization problems which incorporates second-order information in the Newton-decrement framework for convex optimization. We propose the generalized Gauss-Newton with Self-Concordant Regularization (GGN-SCORE) algorithm that updates the minimization variables each time it receives a new input batch. The proposed algorithm exploits the structure of the second-order information in the Hessian matrix, thereby reducing computational overhead. GGN-SCORE demonstrates how to speed up convergence while also improving model generalization for problems that involve regularized minimization under the proposed SCORE framework. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of our method and its fast convergence, which compare favorably against baseline first-order and quasi-Newton methods. Additional experiments involving non-convex (overparameterized) neural network training problems show that the proposed method is promising for non-convex optimization.},

  title={Effects of radiative heat and magnetic field on blood flow in an inclined tapered stenosed porous artery},
  author={Abubakar, J. U. and Adeoye, A. D.},
  abstract={A porous tapered inclined stenosed artery under the influence of magnetic field with radiation was considered. The momentum and energy equations with thin radiation governing the blood flow in the inclined artery were obtained taking the flow to be Newtonian. These equations were simplified under assumptions of mild stenosis, non-dimensionalized and solved using Differential Transform Method (DTM). The DTM were coded on Mathematica software to obtain expressions for velocity, temperature and the volumetric flow rate of the blood. The results presented graphically show that the velocity of the blood flow and the blood temperature decreases as the radiation parameter (N) increases.},
