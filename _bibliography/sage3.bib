However, developing such software is challenging due to interdisciplinary collaboration, technology adoption, and postfunding sustainability. This article presents the experiences and insights of the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment (SAGE) team, which has spent two decades developing translational, cross-disciplinary, collaboration tools to benefit computational science research. With a focus on SAGE and its next-generation iterations, we explore the inherent challenges in translational research, such as fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration, motivating technology adoption, and ensuring postfunding product sustainability. We also discuss the roles of funding agencies, policymakers, and academic institutions in promoting translational research. Although the journey is fraught with challenges, the societal impact and satisfaction derived from translational research underscore its significance in the broader scientific landscape. This article aims to encourage further conversation and the development of effective models for translational software projects.},

However, they use a 1D list structure for cells that introduces and exacerbates user issues, such as messiness, tedious navigation, inefficient use of large screen space, performance of non-linear analyses, and presentation of non-linear narratives. To ameliorate these issues, we designed a prototype extension for Jupyter Notebooks that enables 2D organization of computational notebook cells into multiple columns. In this paper, we present two evaluative studies to determine whether such “2D computational notebooks” provide advantages over the current computational notebook structure. From these studies, we found empirical evidence that our multi-olumn 2D computational notebooks provide enhanced efficiency and usability. We also gathered design feedback which may inform future works. Overall, the prototype was positively received, with some users expressing a clear preference for 2D computational notebooks even at this early stage of development.}

The note attached to the side of the monitor, the papers spread out on the desk, diagrams scrawled on a whiteboard, and even the keys left out on the counter are all examples of using space to recall, reveal relationships, and think. Technological advances have made it possible to construct large display environments in which space has real meaning. This paper examines how increased space affects the way displays are regarded and used within the context of the cognitively demanding task of sensemaking. A pair of studies were conducted demonstrating how the spatial environment supports sensemaking by becoming part of the distributed cognitive process, providing both external memory and a semantic layer.},
