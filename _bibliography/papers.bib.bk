Nevertheless, the interconnect network is a shared resource for both inter-node communication and across-node I/O access, among co-running workloads, leading to inevitable network interference. In this study, we develop MFNetSim, a multi-fidelity modeling framework that enables simulation of multi-traffic simultaneously over the interconnect network, including inter-process communication and I/O traffic. By combining different levels of abstraction, MFNetSim can efficiently co-model the communication and I/O traffic occurring on HPC systems equipped with flash-based storage. We conduct simulation studies of hybrid workloads composed of traditional HPC applications and emerging ML applications on a 1,056-node Dragonfly system with various configurations. Our analysis provides various observations regarding how network interference affects communication and I/O traffic.},

Evaluating individual risk profiles necessitates a deeper understanding of the interplay between different factors such as patient health, spatial tumor location and spread, and risk of subsequent toxicities that can not be adequately captured through simple heuristics. To support clinicians in better understanding tradeoffs when deciding on treatment courses, we developed DITTO, a digital-twin and visual computing system that allows clinicians to analyze detailed risk profiles for each patient, and decide on a treatment plan. DITTO relies on a sequential Deep Reinforcement Learning digital twin (DT) to deliver personalized risk of both long-term and short-term disease outcome and toxicity risk for HNC patients. Based on a participatory collaborative design alongside oncologists, we also implement several visual explainability methods to promote clinical trust and encourage healthy skepticism when using our system. We evaluate the efficacy of DITTO through quantitative evaluation of performance and case studies with qualitative feedback. Finally, we discuss design lessons for developing clinical visual XAI applications for clinical end users.},

Through complex experimental- and simulationbased observations, we integrate these measures as preferred parameters for generating new protein variants and demonstrate our workflow on five diverse supercomputers. We achieve >1 ExaFLOPS sustained performance in mixed precision on each supercomputer and a maximum sustained performance of 4.11 ExaFLOPS and peak performance of 5.57 ExaFLOPS. We establish the scientific performance of our model on two tasks: (1) across a predetermined benchmark dataset of deep mutational scanning experiments to optimize the fitness-determining mutations in the yeast protein HIS7, and (2) in optimizing the design of the enzyme malate dehydrogenase to achieve lower activation barriers (and therefore increased catalytic rates) using simulation data. Our implementation thus sets high watermarks for multimodal protein design workflows.}

These systems distill intricate urban analysis workflows into intuitive, interactive visual representations and interfaces, enabling users to explore, understand, and derive insights from large and complex data, including street-level imagery, street networks, and building geometries. Developing urban visual analytics systems, however, is a challenging endeavor that requires considerable programming expertise and interaction between various multidisciplinary stakeholders. This situation often leads to monolithic and isolated prototypes that are hard to reproduce, combine, or extend. Concurrently, there has been an increase in the availability of general and urban-specific toolkits, frameworks, and authoring tools that are open source and abstract away the need to implement low-level visual analytics functionalities. This paper provides a hierarchical taxonomy of urban visual analytics systems to contextualize how they are usually designed, implemented, and evaluated. We develop this taxonomy across three distinct levels (i.e., dimensions, categories, and tags), juxtaposing visualization with analytics, data, and system dimensions. We then assess the extent to which current open-source toolkits, frameworks, and authoring tools can effectively support the development of components tailored to urban visual analytics, identifying their strengths and limitations in addressing the unique challenges posed by urban data. In doing so, we offer a roadmap that can guide the effective employment of existing resources and chart a pathway for developing and refining future systems.}

Recent efforts tackle this challenge by adopting an analysis-by-synthesis paradigm to learn 3D reconstruction with only 2D annotations. However, existing methods face limitations in both shape reconstruction and texture generation. This paper introduces an innovative Analysis-by-Synthesis Transformer that addresses these limitations in a unified framework by effectively modeling pixel-to-shape and pixel-to-texture relationships. It consists of a Shape Transformer and a Texture Transformer. The Shape Transformer employs learnable shape queries to fetch pixel-level features from the image, thereby achieving high-quality mesh reconstruction and recovering occluded vertices. The Texture Transformer employs texture queries for non-local gathering of texture information and thus eliminates the incorrect inductive bias. Experimental results on CUB-200-2011 and ShapeNet datasets demonstrate superior performance in shape reconstruction and texture generation compared to previous methods.

EVL's introduction of the CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment in 1992, the first widely replicated, projection-based, walk-in, virtual-reality (VR) system in the world, put EVL at the forefront of collaborative, immersive data exploration and analytics. However, the journey did not begin then. Since its founding in 1973, EVL has been developing tools and techniques for real-time, interactive visualizations—pillars of VR. But EVL's culture is also relevant to its successes, as it has always been an interdisciplinary lab that fosters teamwork, where each person's expertise contributes to the development of the necessary tools, hardware, system software, applications, and human interface models to solve problems. Over the years, as multidisciplinary collaborations evolved and advanced scientific instruments and data resources were distributed globally, the need to access and share data and visualizations while working with colleagues, local and remote, synchronous and asynchronous, also became important fields of study. This paper is a retrospective of EVL's past 50 years that surveys the many networked, immersive, collaborative visualization and VR systems and applications it developed and deployed, as well as lessons learned and future plans.}

Prior research has compared human visual inference to that of an optimal Bayesian agent, with deviations from rational analysis viewed as problematic. However, human reliance on non-normative heuristics may prove advantageous in certain circumstances. We investigate scenarios where human intuition might surpass idealized statistical rationality. In two experiments, we examine individuals' accuracy in characterizing the parameters of known data-generating models from bivariate visualizations. Our findings indicate that, although participants generally exhibited lower accuracy compared to statistical models, they frequently outperformed Bayesian agents, particularly when faced with extreme samples. Participants appeared to rely on their internal models to filter out noisy visualizations, thus improving their resilience against spurious data. However, participants displayed overconfidence and struggled with uncertainty estimation. They also exhibited higher variance than statistical machines. Our findings suggest that analyst gut reactions to visualizations may provide an advantage, even when departing from rationality. These results carry implications for designing visual analytics tools, offering new perspectives on how to integrate statistical models and analyst intuition for improved inference and decision-making.},

The effectiveness of current approaches is plagued by difficulties in coordinating representation learning and pixel clustering, modeling the varying feature distributions of different classes, handling outliers and noise, and addressing the pixel class imbalance problem. This paper introduces a novel approach, termed Imbalance-Aware Dense Discriminative Clustering (IDDC), for USS, which addresses all these difficulties in a unified framework. Different from existing approaches, which learn USS in two stages (i.e., generating and updating pseudo masks, or refining and clustering embeddings), IDDC learns pixel-wise feature representation and dense discriminative clustering in an end-to-end and self-supervised manner, through a novel objective function that transfers the manifold structure of pixels in the embedding space of a vision Transformer (ViT) to the label space while tolerating the noise in pixel affinities. During inference, the trained model directly outputs the classification probability of each pixel conditioned on the image. In addition, this paper proposes a new regularizer, based on the Weibull function, to handle pixel class imbalance and cluster degeneration in a single shot. Experimental results demonstrate that IDDC significantly outperforms all previous USS methods on three real-world datasets, COCO-Stuff-27, COCO-Stuff-171, and Cityscapes. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each design. Our code is available at https://github.com/MY-LIU100101/IDDC.}

We propose a real-time technique for dynamically synthesizing stereoscopic 360° panoramas from a collection of depth enhanced monoscopic panoramas. Using depth information, pixels can be transformed into three-dimensional space and re-projected to a different camera location. Our technique allows for head-motion parallax, dynamic depth of field, and integration of properly occluded virtual objects into the captured scene. Our technique shows minimal discrepancies compared to ground truth captures and reduces error when compared to existing stereoscopic 360° panoramic synthesis techniques. Additionally, our technique makes creating interactive extended reality experiences more accessible since monoscopic 360° cameras are much more common than their stereoscopic counterparts.},

While prior research has explored this ability in conventional charts, it is unclear if spatial visualizations used by computational scientists afford a similar ensemble perception capacity. We investigate people’s ability to estimate two summary statistics, mean and variance, from pseudocolor scalar fields. In a crowd- sourced experiment, we find that participants can reliably characterize both statistics, although variance discrimination requires a much stronger signal. Multi-hue and diverging colormaps outperformed monochromatic, luminance ramps in aiding this extraction. Analysis of qualitative responses suggests that participants often estimate the distribution of hotspots and valleys as visual proxies for data statistics. These findings suggest that people’s summary interpretation of spatial datasets is likely driven by the appearance of discrete color segments, rather than assessments of overall luminance. Implicit color segmentation in quantitative displays could thus prove more useful than previously assumed by facilitating quick, gist- level judgments about color-coded visualizations.},

Often, similarity cannot be defined computationally, leading to a need for visual analysis, such as in cases with ensemble, computational, patient cohort, or geospatial data. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of common visual encodings for multivariate data in the context of visual similarity detection. We conducted a user study with 40 participants to measure similarity detection performance and response time under moderate scale (16 items) and large scale (36 items). Our analysis shows that there are significant differences in performance between encodings, especially as the number of items increases. Surprisingly, we found that juxtaposed star plots outperformed superposed parallel coordinate plots. Furthermore, color-cues significantly improved response time, and attenuated error at larger scales. In contrast to existing guidelines, we found that filled star plots (Kiviats) outperformed other encodings in terms of scalability and error.}

Recognizing that such unfilled nodes are well-suited for deep neural network (DNN) training, due to the flexible nature of DNN training tasks, Liu et al. proposed that the re-scaling DNN training tasks to fit gaps in schedules be formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, and demonstrated via simulation the potential benefits of the approach. Here, we introduce MalleTrain, a system that provides the first practical implementation of this approach and that furthermore generalizes it by allowing it to be used even for DNN training applications for which model information is unknown before runtime. Key to this latter innovation is the use of a lightweight online job profiling advisor (JPA) to collect critical scalability information for DNN jobs---information that it then employs to optimize resource allocations dynamically, in real time. We describe the MalleTrain architecture and present the results of a detailed experimental evaluation on a supercomputer GPU cluster and several representative DNN training workloads, including neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization. Our results not only confirm the practical feasibility of leveraging idle supercomputer nodes for DNN training but improve significantly on prior results, improving training throughput by up to 22.3\% without requiring users to provide job scalability information.},

	abstract     = {Over the past decade, several urban visual analytics systems and tools have been proposed to tackle a host of challenges faced by cities, in areas as diverse as transportation, weather, and real estate. Many of these tools have been designed through collaborations with urban experts, aiming to distill intricate urban analysis workflows into interactive visualizations and interfaces. However, the design, implementation, and practical use of these tools still rely on siloed approaches, resulting in bespoke systems that are difficult to reproduce and extend. At the design level, these tools undervalue rich data workflows from urban experts, typically treating them only as data providers and evaluators. At the implementation level, they lack interoperability with other technical frameworks. At the practical use level, they tend to be narrowly focused on specific fields, inadvertently creating barriers to cross-domain collaboration. To address these gaps, we present Curio, a framework for collaborative urban visual analytics. Curio uses a dataflow model with multiple abstraction levels (code, grammar, GUI elements) to facilitate collaboration across the design and implementation of visual analytics components. The framework allows experts to intertwine data preprocessing, management, and visualization stages while tracking the provenance of code and visualizations. In collaboration with urban experts, we evaluate Curio through a diverse set of usage scenarios targeting urban accessibility, urban microclimate, and sunlight access. These scenarios use different types of data and domain methodologies to illustrate Curio's flexibility in tackling pressing societal challenges. Curio is available at urbantk.org/curio.},

ColorMaker combines fluid user interaction with real-time optimization to generate smooth, continuous color ramps. Users specify their loose color preferences while leaving the algorithm to generate precise color sequences, meeting both designer needs and established guidelines. ColorMaker can create new colormaps, including designs accessible for people with color-vision deficiencies, starting from scratch or with only partial input, thus supporting ideation and iterative refinement. We show that our approach can generate designs with similar or superior perceptual characteristics to standard colormaps. A user study demonstrates how designers of varying skill levels can use this tool to create custom, high-quality colormaps. ColorMaker is available at: colormaker.org},

The growing complexity and scale of these systems demand an increase in monitoring data collected at multiple fidelity levels and varying temporal resolutions. In this work, we aim to build a holistic analytical system that helps make sense of such massive data, mainly the hardware logs, job logs, and environment logs collected from disparate subsystems and components of a supercomputer system. This end-to-end log analysis system, coupled with visual analytics support, allows users to glean and promptly extract supercomputer usage and error patterns at varying temporal and spatial resolutions. We use multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD), a technique that depicts high-dimensional data as correlated spatial-temporal variations patterns or modes, to extract variation patterns isolated at specified frequencies. Our improvements to the mrDMD algorithm help promptly reveal useful information in the massive environment log dataset, which is then associated with the processed hardware and job log datasets using our visual analytics system. Furthermore, our system can identify the usage and error patterns filtered at user, project, and subcomponent levels. We exemplify the effectiveness of our approach with two use scenarios with the Cray XC40 supercomputer.},

	abstract     = {Unsupervised video anomaly detection (UVAD) aims to detect abnormal events in videos without any annotations. It remains challenging because anomalies are rare, diverse, and usually not well-defined. Existing UVAD methods are purely data-driven and perform unsupervised learning by identifying various abnormal patterns in videos. Since these methods largely rely on the feature representation and data distribution, they can only learn salient anomalies that are substantially different from normal events but ignore the less distinct ones. To address this challenge, this paper pursues a different approach that leverages data-irrelevant prior knowledge about normal and abnormal events for UVAD. We first propose a new normality prior for UVAD, suggesting that the start and end of a video are predominantly normal. We then propose normality propagation, which propagates normal knowledge based on relationships between video snippets to estimate the normal magnitudes of unlabeled snippets. Finally, unsupervised learning of abnormal detection is performed based on the propagated labels and a new loss re-weighting method. These components are complementary to normality propagation and mitigate the negative impact of incorrectly propagated labels. Extensive experiments on the ShanghaiTech and UCF-Crime benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/shyern/LANP-UVAD.git.},

Hummingbird's story celebrates courage and coming of age through the eyes of a gutsy teen who must outsmart her mother's egotistic boss and survive a dangerous new technology in a live, immersive adventure. Developed at the University of Illinois Chicago by faculty and over 30 students from the departments of Computer Science and Design in partnership with professional theater producers, directors, actors, videographers and composers, this project advanced interdisciplinary collaboration, provided a unique learning environment and broadened the research experience for several cohorts of students. Over 500 people attended Hummingbird's performances at the Tony Award-winning Goodman Theatre's New Stages Festival, Chicago Children's Theater and SIGGRAPH 2022 in Vancouver, Canada, with over 200 active VR participants. In each performance, five VR participants actively collaborate with each other and a lead actor within the VR adventure, contributing problem-solving, collaboration and teamwork, while a greater audience simultaneously follows the virtual performance aspects on a large video wall in real-time. Discussion sessions and audience evaluations followed each performance, informed the Hummingbird team on script, design and interactivity to improve future performances. Through qualitative analysis of audience experiences and insights from our collaboration, we discuss key considerations and design recommendations for integrating VR with live theater. Hummingbird demonstrates how VR can revolutionize theatrical storytelling by enabling traditional theater to narrate epic stories that were once considered too ambitious for traditional stage by extending live theater and making VR accessible to a broader audience. This project serves as a prototype for successful partnerships between nonprofit theater and interdisciplinary research institutions to increase opportunities for cross-disciplinary student education.},

Such taxonomies leverage large sets of correct image labels and provide essential information about the importance of a scientific publication, which could then be used in biocuration tasks. However, the hierarchical nature of the labels, the overhead of processing images, the absence or incompleteness of labelled data and the expertise required to label this type of data impede the creation of useful datasets for biocuration. From a multi-year collaboration with biocurators and text-mining researchers, we derive an iterative visual analytics and active learning (AL) strategy to address these challenges. We implement this strategy in a system called BI-LAVA—Biocuration with Hierarchical Image Labelling through Active Learning and Visual Analytics. BI-LAVA leverages a small set of image labels, a hierarchical set of image classifiers and AL to help model builders deal with incomplete ground-truth labels, target a hierarchical taxonomy of image modalities and classify a large pool of unlabelled images. BI-LAVA's front end uses custom encodings to represent data distributions, taxonomies, image projections and neighbourhoods of image thumbnails, which help model builders explore an unfamiliar image dataset and taxonomy and correct and generate labels. An evaluation with machine learning practitioners shows that our mixed human–machine approach successfully supports domain experts in understanding the characteristics of classes within the taxonomy, as well as validating and improving data quality in labelled and unlabelled collections.}

Large language models (LLMs) are being considered as a promising approach to address some of the challenging problems because of their superior generalization capabilities across domains. The effectiveness of the models and the accuracy of the applications is contingent upon their efficient execution on the underlying hardware infrastructure. Specialized AI accelerator hardware systems have recently become available for accelerating AI applications. However, the comparative performance of these AI accelerators on large language models has not been previously studied. In this paper, we systematically study LLMs on multiple AI accelerators and GPUs and evaluate their performance characteristics for these models. We evaluate these systems with (i) a micro-benchmark using a core transformer block, (ii) a GPT- 2 model, and (iii) an LLM-driven science use case, GenSLM. We present our findings and analyses of the models' performance to better understand the intrinsic capabilities of AI accelerators. Furthermore, our analysis takes into account key factors such as sequence lengths, scaling behavior, sparsity, and sensitivity to gradient accumulation steps.},

For example, in drug discovery research, chemists investigate sets of thousands of chemical compounds in order to identify novel yet structurally similar synthetic compounds to replace natural products. Manually exploring the chemical space inhabited by all possible molecules and chemical compounds is impractical, and therefore presents a challenge. To fill this gap, we present ChemoGraph, a novel visual analytics technique for interactively exploring related chemicals. In ChemoGraph, we formalize a chemical space as a hypergraph and apply novel machine learning models to compute related chemical compounds. It uses a database to find related compounds from a known space and a machine learning model to generate new ones, which helps enlarge the known space. Moreover, ChemoGraph highlights interactive features that support users in viewing, comparing, and organizing computationally identified related chemicals. With a drug discovery usage scenario and initial expert feedback from a case study, we demonstrate the usefulness of ChemoGraph.},

Visualizing dynamic multivariate networks is of great significance to the visualization community because of their wide applications across multiple domains. However, it remains challenging because the techniques should focus on representing the network structure, attributes and their evolution concurrently. Many real-world network analysis tasks require the concurrent usage of the three aspects of the dynamic multivariate networks. In this paper, we analyze current techniques and present a taxonomy to classify the existing visualization techniques based on three aspects: temporal encoding, topology encoding, and attribute encoding.

One of the key challenges for RL driven scheduling is state representation for RL agent (i.e., capturing essential features of dynamic scheduling environment for decision making). Existing state encoding approaches either lack critical scheduling information or suffer from poor scalability. In this study, we present SEM (Scalable and Efficient encoding Model) for general RL driven scheduling in HPC. It captures system resource and waiting job state, both being critical information for scheduling. It encodes these pieces of information into a fixed-sized vector as an input to the agent. A typical agent is built on deep neural network, and its training/inference cost grows exponentially with the size of its input. Production HPC systems contain a large number of computer nodes. As such, a direct encoding of each of the system resources would lead to poor scalability of the RL agent. SEM uses two techniques to transform the system resource state into a small-sized vector, hence being capable of representing a large number of system resources in a vector of 100--200. Our trace-based simulations demonstrate that compared to the existing state encoding methods, SEM can achieve 9X training speedup and 6X inference speedup while maintaining comparable scheduling performance.},

Here we describe how to realize a novel use for these otherwise wasted resources, namely, deep neural network (DNN) training. This important workload is easily organized as many small fragments that can be configured dynamically to fit essentially any node × time hole in a supercomputer's schedule. We describe how the task of rescaling suitable DNN training tasks to fit dynamically changing holes can be formulated as a deterministic mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based resource allocation algorithm, and show that this MILP problem can be solved efficiently at run time. We show further how this MILP problem can be adapted to optimize for administrator- or user-defined metrics. We validate our method with supercomputer scheduler logs and different DNN training scenarios, and demonstrate efficiencies of up to 93\% compared with running the same training tasks on dedicated nodes. Our method thus enables substantial supercomputer resources to be allocated to DNN training with no impact on other applications.},

As we progress towards exascale and GPU-driven High-Performance Computing (HPC) and confront larger problem sizes, the choice becomes increasingly stark: to compromise data fidelity or to reduce resolution. To navigate this challenge, this study advocates for the use of in situ analysis and visualization techniques. These allow more frequent data "snapshots" to be taken directly from memory, thus avoiding the need for disruptive checkpointing.

	abstract     = {Recent technological innovations have led to an increase in the availability of 3D urban data, such as shadow, noise, solar potential, and earthquake simulations. These spatiotemporal datasets create opportunities for new visualizations to engage experts from different domains to study the dynamic behavior of urban spaces in this under explored dimension. However, designing 3D spatiotemporal urban visualizations is challenging, as it requires visual strategies to support analysis of time-varying data referent to the city geometry. Although different visual strategies have been used in 3D urban visual analytics, the question of how effective these visual designs are at supporting spatiotemporal analysis on building surfaces remains open. To investigate this, in this paper we first contribute a series of analytical tasks elicited after interviews with practitioners from three urban domains. We also contribute a quantitative user study comparing the effectiveness of four representative visual designs used to visualize 3D spatiotemporal urban data: spatial juxtaposition, temporal juxtaposition, linked view, and embedded view. Participants performed a series of tasks that required them to identify extreme values on building surfaces over time. Tasks varied in granularity for both space and time dimensions. Our results demonstrate that participants were more accurate using plot-based visualizations (linked view, embedded view) but faster using color-coded visualizations (spatial juxtaposition, temporal juxtaposition). Our results also show that, with increasing task complexity, plot-based visualizations perform better in preserving efficiency (time, accuracy) compared to color-coded visualizations. Based on our findings, we present a set of takeaways with design recommendations for 3D spatiotemporal urban visualizations for researchers and practitioners. Lastly, we report on a series of interviews with four practitioners, and their feedback and suggestions for further work on the visualizations to support 3D spatiotemporal urban data analysis.},

	abstract     = {Abstract Understanding functional correlations between the activities of neuron populations is vital for the analysis of neuronal networks. Analyzing large-scale neuroimaging data obtained from hundreds of neurons simultaneously poses significant visualization challenges. We developed V-NeuroStack, a novel network visualization tool to visualize data obtained using calcium imaging of spontaneous activity of neurons in a mouse brain slice as well as in vivo using two-photon imaging. V-NeuroStack creates 3D time stacks by stacking 2D time frames for a time-series dataset. It provides a web interface to explore and analyze data using both 3D and 2D visualization techniques. Previous attempts to analyze such data have been limited by the tools available to visualize large numbers of correlated activity traces. V-NeuroStack's 3D view is used to explore patterns in dynamic large-scale correlations between neurons over time. The 2D view is used to examine any timestep of interest in greater detail. Furthermore, a dual-line graph provides the ability to explore the raw and first-derivative values of activity from an individual or a functional cluster of neurons. V-NeuroStack can scale to datasets with at least a few thousand temporal snapshots. It can potentially support future advancements in in vitro and in vivo data capturing techniques to bring forth novel hypotheses by allowing unambiguous visualization of massive patterns in neuronal activity data.},

Data portals are commonly used to organize, publish, and securely disseminate data—a critical step toward making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). However, the diversity of scientific data types, sizes, and their location present significant challenges, e.g., it is difficult for portals to accommodate heterogenous research products when using strict metadata schemas and rigid interfaces. Thus, there is a need for a user-customizable data portal solution that enables rapid creation of new portals that may be tailored to a researchers needs while accommodating distributed data sources and engaging advanced computing resources. In this paper, we present the Django Globus Portal Framework (DGPF), a tool designed to help users rapidly create secure, customizable, and extensible data portals. DGPF is a powerful and flexible framework that builds upon the Globus platform for authentication, data sharing, creation of automation flows, and search capabilities, allowing for seamless integration with existing research workflows.

This end-to-end log analysis system, coupled with visual analytics support, allows users to glean and promptly extract supercomputer usage and error patterns at varying temporal and spatial resolutions. We use multiresolution dynamic mode decomposition (mrDMD), a technique that depicts high-dimensional data as correlated spatial-temporal variations patterns or modes, to extract variation patterns isolated at specified frequencies. Our improvements to the mrDMD algorithm help promptly reveal useful information in the massive environment log dataset, which is then associated with the processed hardware and job log datasets using our visual analytics system. Furthermore, our system can identify the usage and error patterns filtered at user, project, and subcomponent levels.

By pre-training on over 110 million prokaryotic gene sequences and fine-tuning a SARS-CoV-2-specific model on 1.5 million genomes, we show that GenSLMs can accurately and rapidly identify variants of concern. Thus, to our knowledge, GenSLMs represents one of the first whole-genome scale foundation models which can generalize to other prediction tasks. We demonstrate scaling of GenSLMs on GPU-based supercomputers and AI-hardware accelerators utilizing 1.63 Zettaflops in training runs with a sustained performance of 121 PFLOPS in mixed precision and peak of 850 PFLOPS.

	abstract     = {While designing sustainable and resilient urban built environment is increasingly promoted around the world, significant data gaps have made research on pressing sustainability issues challenging to carry out. Pavements are known to have strong economic and environmental impacts; however, most cities lack a spatial catalog of their surfaces due to the cost-prohibitive and time-consuming nature of data collection. Recent advancements in computer vision, together with the availability of street-level images, provide new opportunities for cities to extract large-scale built environment data with lower implementation costs and higher accuracy. In this paper, we propose CitySurfaces, an active learning-based framework that leverages computer vision techniques for classifying sidewalk materials using widely available street-level images. We trained the framework on images from New York City and Boston and the evaluation results show a 90.5% mIoU score. Furthermore, we evaluated the framework using images from six different cities, demonstrating that it can be applied to regions with distinct urban fabrics, even outside the domain of the training data. CitySurfaces can provide researchers and city agencies with a low-cost, accurate, and extensible method to collect sidewalk material data which plays a critical role in addressing major sustainability issues, including climate change and surface water management.},

	abstract     = {In the last 20 years, extreme weather-related events like floods, landslides, droughts, and wildfires have caused the death of 1.23 million people and a loss of 2.97 trillion dollars. Studies show that low and lower-middle income countries are the most impacted ones given the lack of investment in disaster risk management. To reduce the impact of these events, weather researchers have been developing numerical weather models that inform public agencies about the impending extreme events in advance. Despite being powerful tools, these models can suffer from several sources of uncertainty, ranging from the approximation of micro-scale physical processes to the location-dependent calibration of parameters, which is especially critical in developing countries. To minimize uncertainty effects, researchers generate several different weather scenarios to compose an ensemble of simulations that typically are inspected using manual, laborious, and error-prone approaches. In this paper, we propose an interactive visual analytics system, called X-Weather, developed in close collaboration with weather researchers from Brazil. Our system contributes a set of statistics and probability-based visualizations that allows the assessment of extreme weather events by effortlessly navigating through and comparing ensemble members. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the system through two case studies analyzing tragic events that happened in the mountain region of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.},

	abstract     = {Pose guided person image generation means to generate a photo-realistic person image conditioned on an input person image and a desired pose. This task requires spatial manipulation of the source image according to the target pose. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are inherently limited to geometric transformations due to the fixed geometric structures in their building modules, i.e., convolution, pooling and unpooling, which cannot handle large motion and occlusions caused by large pose transform. This paper introduces a novel two-stream context-aware appearance transfer network to address these challenges. It is a three-stage architecture consisting of a source stream and a target stream. Each stage features an appearance transfer module, a multi-scale context module and two-stream feature fusion modules. The appearance transfer module handles large motion by finding the dense correspondence between the two-stream feature maps and then transferring the appearance information from the source stream to the target stream. The multi-scale context module handles occlusion via contextual modeling, which is achieved by atrous convolutions of different sampling rates. Both quantitative and qualitative results indicate the proposed network can effectively handle challenging cases of large pose transform while retaining the appearance details. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, it achieves comparable or superior performance using much fewer parameters while being significantly faster.},

They are often used to model the natural uncertainty present in real phenomena or to describe the properties of a data set. Designing efficient visual metaphors to convey probability distributions is, however, a difficult problem. This fact is especially true for geographical data, where conveying the spatial context constrains the design space. While many different alternatives have been proposed to solve this problem, they focus on representing data variability. However, they are not designed to support spatial analytical tasks involving probability quantification. The present work aims to adapt recent non-spatial approaches to the geographical context, in order to support probability quantification tasks. We also present a user study that compares the efficiency of these approaches in terms of both accuracy and usability.},

Online analysis methods are needed to enable the collection of only interesting subsets of such massive data streams, such as by explicitly discarding some data elements or by directing instruments to relevant areas of experimental space. Thus, methods are required for configuring and running distributed computing pipelines---what we call flows---that link instruments, computers (e.g., for analysis, simulation, artificial intelligence [AI] model training), edge computing (e.g., for analysis), data stores, metadata catalogs, and high-speed networks. We review common patterns associated with such flows and describe methods for instantiating these patterns. We present experiences with the application of these methods to the processing of data from five different scientific instruments, each of which engages powerful computers for data inversion,model training, or other purposes. We also discuss implications of such methods for operators and users of scientific facilities.},

By simplifying the development process, VisSnippets removes the need to scaffold and integrate interactive visualization applications by hand. Users write reusable blocks of code called “snippets” for data retrieval, transformation, and visualization. By composing dataflows from the group’s collective snippet pool, users can quickly execute and explore complementary or contrasting analyses.

Instead of traversing the memory graph, our system indexes pre-processed join elements that are organized in a graph structure. We analyze the Dbpedia data-set (derived from the Wikipedia corpus) and compare our access method to the graph traversal access approach which we also devise. Results show from our experiments that the distributed, pre-processed graph approach to accessing linked data is faster than the traversal approach over a specific range of linked queries.},

This paper presents the design and results of a user study that focused on mixed presence collaboration using large-scale tiled display walls. The research was conducted in order to compare data synchronization schemes for multi-user visualization applications. Our study compared three techniques for sharing data between display spaces with varying constraints and affordances. The results provide empirical evidence that using data sharing techniques with continuous synchronization between the sites lead to improved collaboration for a search and analysis task between remotely located groups. We have also identified aspects of synchronized sessions that result in increased remote collaborator awareness and parallel task coordination. It is believed that this research will lead to better utilization of large-scale tiled display walls for distributed group work.},

It uses VR technology to immerse participants in the minds of people who experienced torture and interrogation during the war to understand its current social and psychological consequences. The powerful content of this artwork focuses on the impact of war and trauma on veterans, and utilizes the power of VR as a medium to evoke empathy, understanding and awareness. This work was developed at the Electronic Visualization Lab in Chicago through a unique cross-disciplinary international collaboration between artists, scientists, and researchers from five different Universities. The methods developed for this project allow hands-on education of virtual reality by letting students create their own virtual environments and exhibit them in the CAVE2 quickly.

BranchingSets introduces novel user-driven methods to procedurally navigate the graph topology and to interactively inspect complex, hierarchical data associated with individual nodes. Results indicate that users find the technique engaging and easy to use. This is further confirmed by a quantitative study that compares the effectiveness of the visual encodings used in BranchingSets to other techniques for displaying set membership within node-link diagrams, finding our technique more accurate and more efficient for facilitating interactive queries on networks containing nodes that belong to multiple sets.},

An SRDE can be any configuration of displays, ranging from a single monitor to a wall of tiled flat-panel displays. SAGE2 creates a seamless ultra-high resolution desktop across the SRDE. Users can wirelessly connect to the SRDE with their own devices in order to interact with the system. Many users can simultaneously utilize a drag-and-drop interface to transfer local documents and show them on the SRDE, use a mouse pointer and keyboard to interact with existing content that is on the SRDE and share their screen so that it is viewable to all. SAGE2 can be used in many configurations and is able to support many communities working with various types of media and high-resolution content, from research meetings to creative session to education. SAGE2 is browser-based, utilizing a web server to host content, WebSockets for message passing and HTML with JavaScript for rendering and interaction. Recent web developments, with the emergence of HTML5, have allowed browsers to use advanced rendering techniques without requiring plug-ins (canvas drawing, WebGL 3D rendering, native video player, etc.). One major benefit of browser-based software is that there are no installation requirements for users and it is inherently cross-platform. A user simply needs a web browser on the device he/she wishes to use as an interaction tool for the SRDE. This lowers considerably the barrier of entry to engage in meaningful collaboration sessions.},

Groupware must be flexible so that it can be incorporated into a variety of workspaces in order to successfully facilitate this type of mixed presence collaboration. We have developed two new techniques for sharing and synchronizing multi-user applications between heterogeneous large-scale shared displays. The first new technique partitions displays into a perfectly mirrored public space and a local private space. The second new technique enables user-controlled partial synchronization, where different attributes of an application can be synchronized or controlled independently. This paper presents two main contributions of our work: 1) identifying deficiencies in current groupware for interacting with data during mixed presence collaboration, and 2) developing two multi-user data synchronization techniques to address these deficiencies and extend current collaborative infrastructure for large-scale shared displays.},

A critical challenge here is that the reduced dataset is typically located on a subset of the nodes and needs to be written out to storage. Data coupling in multiphysics codes also exhibits a sparse data movement pattern wherein data movement occurs among a subset of nodes. We evaluate the performance of data movement for sparse data patterns on the IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputing system ``Mira'' and identify performance bottlenecks. We propose a multipath data movement algorithm for sparse data patterns based on an adaptation of a maximum flow algorithm together with breadth-first search that fully exploits all the underlying data paths and I/O nodes to improve data movement. We demonstrate the efficacy of our solutions through a set of microbenchmarks and application benchmarks on Mira scaling up to 131,072 compute cores. The results show that our approach achieves up to 5× improvement in achievable throughput compared with the default mechanisms.},

There are only a handful of methods that can be used to systematically study how people use visualizations, making it difficult for researchers to capture and characterize the subtlety of cognitive and interaction behaviors users exhibit during visual analysis. To validate and improve visualization design, it is important for researchers to be able to assess and understand how users interact with visualization systems under realistic scenarios. This article presents a methodology for modeling and evaluating the behavior of users in exploratory visual analysis. We model visual exploration using a Markov chain process comprising transitions between mental, interaction, and computational states. These states and the transitions between them can be deduced from a variety of sources, including verbal transcripts, videos and audio recordings, and log files. This model enables the evaluator to characterize the cognitive and computational processes that are essential to insight acquisition in exploratory visual analysis and reconstruct the dynamics of interaction between the user and the visualization system. We illustrate this model with two exemplar user studies, and demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative analytical tools it affords.},

We present the results of a small-scale study to better understand how display size and resolution affect insight. Analyzing participants' verbal statements, we find preliminary evidence that larger displays with more pixels can significantly increase the number of discoveries reported during visual exploration, while yielding broader, more integrative insights. Furthermore, we find important differences in how participants performed the same visual exploration task using displays of varying sizes. We tie these results to extant work and propose explanations by considering the cognitive and interaction costs associated with visual exploration.},

These displays can be connected to distributed computing resources over high-speed network, providing effective means for researchers to visualize, interact with, and understand large volumes of datasets. Typically large display walls are built by tiling multiple physical displays together and running a tiled display wall required a cluster of computers. With the advent of advanced graphics hardware, a single computer can now drive over a dozen displays, thereby greatly reducing the cost of ownership and maintenance of a tiled display wall system. This in turn enables a broader user base to take advantage of such technologies. Since tiled display walls are also well suited to collaborative work, users tend to launch and operate multiple applications simultaneously. To ensure that applications maintain a high degree of responsiveness to the users even under heavy use loads, the display wall must now ensure that the limited system resources are prioritized to maximize interactivity rather than thread-level fair sharing or overall job-completion throughput. In this paper, we present a new resource scheduling scheme that is specifically designed to prioritize responsiveness in collaborative large display wall environments where multiple users can interact with multiple applications simultaneously. We evaluate our scheduling scheme with a user study involving groups of users interacting simultaneously on a tiled display wall with multiple applications. Results show that our scheduling framework provided a higher frame-rate for applications, which led to a significantly higher user performance (approx. 25%) in a target acquisition test when compared against traditional operating system scheduling scheme.},

Since user strategy would likely influence the outcome of visual analysis and the nature of insights acquired, it is important to understand how the analytic behavior of users is shaped by variations in the design of the visualization interface. This paper presents a technique for evaluating user behavior in exploratory visual analysis scenarios. We characterize visual exploration as a fluid activity involving transitions between mental and interaction states. We show how micro-patterns in these transitions can be captured and analyzed quantitatively to reveal differences in the exploratory behavior of users, given variations in the visualization interface.},

	abstract     = {In the domain of large-scale visualization instruments, hybrid reality environments (HREs) are a recent innovation that combines the best-in-class capabilities of immersive environments, with the best-in-class capabilities of ultra-high-resolution display walls. HREs create a seamless 2D/3D environment that supports both information-rich analysis as well as virtual reality simulation exploration at a resolution matching human visual acuity. Co-located research groups in HREs tend to work on a variety of tasks during a research session (sometimes in parallel), and these tasks require 2D data views, 3D views, linking between them and the ability to bring in (or hide) data quickly as needed. In this paper we present Omegalib, a software framework that facilitates application development on HREs. Omegalib is designed to support dynamic reconfigurability of the display environment, so that areas of the display can be interactively allocated to 2D or 3D workspaces as needed. Compared to existing frameworks and toolkits, Omegalib makes it possible to have multiple immersive applications running on a cluster-controlled display system, have different input sources dynamically routed to applications, and have rendering results optionally redirected to a distributed compositing manager. Omegalib supports pluggable front-ends, to simplify the integration of third-party libraries like OpenGL, OpenSceneGraph, and the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). We present examples of applications developed with Omegalib for the 74-megapixel, 72-tile CAVE2™ system, and show how a Hybrid Reality Environment proved effective in supporting work for a co-located research group in the environmental sciences.},

Often this data has to be processed on powerful remote computing and storage resources, converted to high-resolution digital media and yet visualized on a local tiled-display. This is the basic premise behind the OptIPuter model. While the streaming middleware to enable this kind of work exists and the optical networking infrastructure is becoming more widely available, enabling multi-user interaction in such environments is still a challenge. In this paper, we present an interaction system we developed to support collaborative work on large high-resolution displays using multiple interaction devices and scalable, distributed user interface widgets. This system allows multiple users to simultaneously interact with local or remote data, media and applications, through a variety of physical interaction devices on large high-resolution displays. Finally, we present our experiences with using the system over the past two years. Most importantly, having an actual working system based on the OptIPuter model allows us to focus our research efforts to better understand how to make such high-resolution environments more user-friendly and usable in true real-world collaborative scenarios as opposed to constrained laboratory settings.},

	abstract     = {Ultra-high-resolution tiled-display walls are typically driven by a cluster of computers. Each computer may drive one or more displays. Synchronization between the computers is necessary to ensure that animated imagery displayed on the wall appears seamless. Most tiled-display middleware systems are designed around the assumption that only a single application instance is running in the tiled display at a time. Therefore synchronization can be achieved with a simple solution such as a networked barrier. When a tiled display has to support multiple applications at the same time, however, the simple networked barrier approach does not scale. In this paper we propose and experimentally validate two synchronization algorithms to achieve low-latency, intertile synchronization for multiple applications with independently varying frame rates. The two-phase algorithm is more generally applicable to various highresolution tiled display systems. The one-phase algorithm provides superior results but requires support for the Network Time Protocol and is more CPU-intensive.},

In particular, the goals of our pilot study (n = 1,744) are to determine whether the specific avatar being developed is capable of conveying emotional states (Ekman{\"o}s six classic emotions) via facial features and whether a realistic avatar is an appropriate vehicle for conveying the emotional states accompanying spoken information. The results of this study show that happiness and sadness are correctly identified with a high degree of accuracy while the other four emotional states show mixed results.},

	abstract     = {The OptIPortal is a tiled display that is the visual interface to the OptIPuter, a global-scale computing system tied together by tens of gigabits of networking. The main point of the OptIPuter project is to examine a “future” in which networking is not a bottleneck to local, regional, national and international computing. OptIPortals are designed to allow collaborative sharing over 1-10 gigabit/second networks of extremely high-resolution graphic output, as well as video streams. OptIPortals typically consist of an array of 4 to 70 LCD display panels (either 2-megapixel or 4-megapixel each), driven by an appropriately sized cluster of PCs, with optimized graphics processors and network interface cards. Rather than exist as one-of-a-kind laboratory prototypes, OptIPortals are designed to be openly and widely replicated, balancing the state of the art of PCs, graphic processing, networks, servers, software, middleware, and user interfaces, and installed in the context of a laboratory or office conference room. Discussed in detail are the design decisions made to achieve a replicable tiled display that can be built by computational science researchers in various disciplines.},

LambdaRAM is a high-performance, multi-dimensional, distributed cache, that takes advantage of memory from multiple clusters interconnected by ultra-high-speed networking, to provide applications with rapid access to both local and remote data. It mitigates latency bottlenecks by employing proactive latency-mitigation heuristics based on an application’s access patterns. We present results using LambdaRAM to rapidly stride through remote multi-dimensional NASA Modeling, Analysis and Prediction (MAP) 2006 project datasets, based on time and geographical coordinates, to compute wind shear for cyclone and hurricane and tropical cyclone analysis. Our current experiments have demonstrated up to a 20-fold speedup in the computation of wind shear with LambdaRAM.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach to distribute high-resolution images to multiple tiled displays in real-time using a high-performance PC cluster. This approach allows users to share their visualization applications and videos on multiple tiled displays, repositioning and resizing each application window independently. These operations require high-resolution image multicasting from a rendering cluster to multiple display clusters. A high-performance bridging system called SAGE Bridge performs the image multicasting on a high-performance PC cluster. We show in several experiments that this system enables sharing of high-resolution scientific animations and high-definition videos (with audio) between multiples international sites, hence creating virtual research laboratories (i.e. virtual organizations), as observed in a figure given in this article.},

The effectiveness measurement problem is described in this article by means of a methodology to find the best design review process subject to certain criteria. The effectiveness measurement problem originates from our inability to logically understand the impact of a process or media differences on design comprehension; and it reconciles such differences in strengths of media that cannot be effectively covered by the relationship problem described in the first technical note. We illustrate the methodology with design review experiments where Computer Aided Virtual Environment (CAVE™2) is investigated as a possible virtual environment for product design reviews. Based on the measurable usability attributes of the design review process, the CAVE was considered to be a good solution achieving maximum utility. However, costs may hinder the ability to use CAVE as a tool. }},

This paper will introduce Quanta’s architecture and capabilities, with particular attention given to its aggressive and predictable high performance data transport scheme called Reliable Blast UDP (RBUDP).

Utilizing our VR-based visual analysis tool, Cave5D, we construct interactive virtual environments based on graphical representations of bathymetry/topography, above-surface imags, in-water objects, and environmental conditions. The data sources may include archived data stores and real-time inputs from model simulations or advanced observational platforms. The Cave5D application allows users to view, navigate, and interact with time-varying data in a fully 3D context, thus preserving necessary geospatial relationships crucial for intuitive analysis. Collaborative capabilities have been integrated into Cave5D to enable users at many distributed sites to interact in near real-time with each other and with the data in a many-to-many session. The ability to rapidly configure scenario-based missions in a shared virtual environment has the potential to change the way mission critical information is used by the MCM community.}

	abstract     = {The airborne particles present in certain hospital environments, such as the tuberculosis isolation or operating rooms, can be extremely harmful for patients and/or hospital personnel. An important issue during the design of hospital facilities is an efficient airborne particle removal system. A near-optimal setup of the parameters that affect the airflow, and consequently the airborne particle trajectories within the room is desirable. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an alternative to tedious and time-consuming experimental investigations during the design phase, when a large number of alternatives need to be evaluated. The main limitations of CFD application in building design are the high level of skill required, the complexity of the setup phase, and the difficulty of output data interpretation using common 2D (two-dimensional) display devices. A virtual reality (VR) environment can help in overcoming some of these limitations. A CFD/VR procedure for design of contaminant-free hospital facilities is presented in this paper. By means of a VR preprocessing step, inferior solutions can be discharged to drastically reduce the number of configurations to investigate. Then, a CFD/VR tool is used to explore the restricted set of room layouts. The 3D (three-dimensional), immersive visualisation of an indoor space and of the particle motion inside it allows the user to really see the particle flows and consequently understand the effects of room parameters on particle motion throughout the room. In this way a close-to-optimal configuration of the room layout and of the ventilation system can be achieved more speedily and more conveniently compared to traditional CFD investigations.},

	abstract     = {Collision detection becomes a key issue when we want to model interactions between general, nonconvex objects in virtual reality applications which arise in manufacturing process domain. Despite significant progress which has been made in developing efficient, exact collision detection algorithms for convex objects, limited and slow progress has been reported in developing collision detection algorithms for general, nonconvex objects. To narrow this gap we introduce a concept of virtual objects which extends applicability of exact collision detection algorithms to nonconvex objects. This paper presents a methodology to encapsulate into virtual objects the surface patches of interest for collision detection as well as the automatic procedures for creation of virtual objects and for partitioning them into convex pieces.The collision detection technique described in this paper is best suited for interactive simulation and animation applications where high accuracy of object contact modeling is required. Examples include virtual assembly; mobile robot simulation; and simulation of manufacturing processes where accurate modeling of near-miss detection is essential, e.g. robotic painting, robotic welding, and NC machining operations.},

CAVE users do not need to wear helmets, don bulky gloves and heavy electronics packs, or be pushed about by movement restricting platforms. Instead, they put on a pair of lightweight glasses and walk into the Cave, a 27 m3  room with an open side and no ceiling. The Cave is in fact a partial cube, with the top and one vertical side missing. The three vertical sides are 3 m by 3 m rear projection screens facing the viewer, and the floor is a front projection screen.

	abstract     = {Object instancing is the efficient method of representing an hierarchical object with a directed graph instead of a tree. If this graph contains a cycle then the object it represents is a linear fractal. Linear fractals are difficult to render for three specific reasons: (1) ray-fractal intersection is not trivial, (2) surface normals are undefined and (3) the object aliases at all sampling resolutions.Ray-fractal intersections are efficiently approximated to sub-pixel accuracy using procedural bounding volumes and a careful determination of the size of a pixel, giving the perception that the surface is infinitely detailed. Furthermore, a surface normal for these non-differentiable surfaces is defined and analyzed. Finally, the concept of antialiasing "covers" is adapted and used to solve the problem of sampling fractal surfaces.An initial bounding volume estimation method is also described, allowing a linear fractal to be rendered given only its iterated, function system. A parallel implementation of these methods is described and applications of these results to the rendering of other fractal models are given.},

The chapter presents the history and recent development of videogames. There are many ways to differentiate one videogame from another. The discussion in this chapter attempts to set forth the currently important distinctions of videogame. One way to categorize coin-op games is by the number of players. One and two-player games exist, and although all games allow players to take turns, two-player games allow both to play at the same time: against the machine, against each other, or both. Videogame hardware is examined, starting with the cabinet and proceeding inward to the circuits and logic. The coin-operated videogame is currently available in four physical configurations: full-size upright, mini upright, sit-in, and cocktail table. Animation techniques are rather dependent on the hardware. They can be divided into two types: vector and raster. Vector graphics are drawn random scan and are easily geometrically transformed as wire-frame objects in real time. Raster images can be moved only in x and y directions and possibly rotated by 90$\,^{\circ}$; animation is done as in cartoons by flipping different images at least 12 times a second.},

Csuri, project director). The system, called "The Graphics Symbiosis System" or "Grass" was first designed to help artists interactively explore computer art without the constant companionship of a programmer. Over the past three years, it has been expanded at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (Figure 1) and is now the image generation portion of a short-order full-color animated videotape production facility called "The Circle Graphics Habitat." Combined with Dan Sandin's Image Processor, the system is sufficiently powerful and flexible to be used in real-time performance context here at UICC.},
