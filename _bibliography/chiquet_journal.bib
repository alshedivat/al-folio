  abstract =	 {The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) is arguably one of the
                  most popular measures for cluster comparison. The
                  adjustment of the ARI is based on a hypergeometric
                  distribution assumption which is not satisfactory
                  from a modeling point of view because (i) it is not
                  appropriate when the two clusterings are dependent,
                  (ii) it forces the size of the clusters, and (iii)
                  it ignores the randomness of the sampling. In this
                  work, we present a new "modified" version of the
                  Rand Index. First, as in Russell et al. (J Malar
                  Inst India 3(1), 1940 ), we consider only the pairs
                  consistent by similarity and ignore the pairs
                  consistent by difference to define the MRI. Second,
                  we base the adjusted version, called MARI, on a
                  multinomial distribution instead of a hypergeometric
                  distribution. The multinomial model is advantageous
                  because it does not force the size of the clusters,
                  correctly models randomness and is easily extended
                  to the dependent case. We show that ARI is biased
                  under the multinomial model and that the difference
                  between ARI and MARI can be significant for small n
                  but essentially vanishes for large n, where n is the
                  number of individuals. Finally, we provide an
                  efficient algorithm to compute all these quantities
                  ((A)RI and M(A)RI) based on a sparse representation
                  of the contingency table in our aricode package. The
                  space and time complexity is linear with respect to
                  the number of samples and, more importantly, does
                  not depend on the number of clusters as we do not
                  explicitly compute the contingency table.},

                  evaluate risks and to efficiently manage ecosystems
                  and their associated services. Agrosystems are the
                  target of multiple stressors that can affect many
                  species through effects cascading along food
                  webs. However, classic biomonitoring, focused on
                  species diversity or indicator species, might be a
                  poor predictor of the risk of such whole-ecosystem
                  perturbations. Thanks to high-throughput sequencing
                  methods, however, it might be possible to obtain
                  sufficient information about entire ecological
                  communities to infer the functioning of their
                  associated interaction networks, and thus monitor
                  more closely the risk of the collapse of entire food
                  webs due to external stressors. In the course of the
                  ‘next-generation biomonitoring’ project, we
                  collectively sought to experiment with this idea of
                  inferring ecological networks on the basis of
                  metabarcoding information gathered on different
                  systems. We here give an overview of issues and
                  preliminary results associated with this endeavour
                  and highlight the main difficulties that such
                  next-generation biomonitoring is still facing. Going
                  from sampling protocols up to methods for comparing
                  inferred networks, through biomolecular,
                  bioinformatic, and network inference, we review all
                  steps of the process, with a view towards generality
                  and transferability towards other systems.},

  abstract =	 {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The stochastic block model is a
                  popular probabilistic model for random graphs. It is
                  commonly used to cluster network data by aggregating
                  nodes that share similar connectivity patterns into
                  blocks. When fitting a stochastic block model to a
                  partially observed network, it is important to
                  consider the underlying process that generates the
                  missing values, otherwise the inference may be
                  biased. This paper presents missSBM, an R package
                  that fits stochastic block models when the network
                  is partially observed, i.e., the adjacency matrix
                  contains not only 1s or 0s encoding the presence or
                  absence of edges, but also NAs encoding the missing
                  information between pairs of nodes. This package
                  implements a set of algorithms to adjust the binary
                  stochastic block model, possibly in the presence of
                  external covariates, by performing variational
                  inference suitable for several observation
                  processes. Our implementation automatically explores
                  different block numbers to select the most relevant
                  model according to the integrated classification
                  likelihood criterion. The integrated classification
                  likelihood criterion can also help determine which
                  observation process best fits a given
                  dataset. Finally, missSBM can be used to perform
                  imputation of missing entries in the adjacency
                  matrix. We illustrate the package on a network
                  dataset consisting of interactions between political
                  blogs sampled during the 2007 French presidential
                  election.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

                  and wine quality. Breeding is a key lever to meet
                  this challenge, and genomic prediction a promising
                  tool to accelerate breeding programs. Multivariate
                  methods are potentially more accurate than
                  univariate ones. Moreover, some prediction methods
                  also provide marker selection, thus allowing
                  quantitative trait loci (QTLs) detection and the
                  identification of positional candidate genes. To
                  study both genomic prediction and QTL detection for
                  drought-related traits in grapevine, we applied
                  several methods, interval mapping (IM) as well as
                  univariate and multivariate penalized regression, in
                  a bi-parental progeny. With a dense genetic map, we
                  simulated two traits under four QTL
                  configurations. The penalized regression method
                  Elastic Net (EN) for genomic prediction, and
                  controlling the marginal False Discovery Rate on EN
                  selected markers to prioritize the QTLs. Indeed,
                  penalized methods were more powerful than IM for QTL
                  detection across various genetic
                  architectures. Multivariate prediction did not
                  perform better than its univariate counterpart,
                  despite strong genetic correlation between
                  traits. Using 14 traits measured in semi-controlled
                  conditions under different watering conditions,
                  penalized regression methods proved very efficient
                  for intra-population prediction whatever the genetic
                  architecture of the trait, with predictive abilities
                  reaching 0.68. Compared to a previous study on the
                  same traits, these methods applied on a denser map
                  found new QTLs controlling traits linked to drought
                  tolerance and provided relevant candidate
                  genes. Overall, these findings provide a strong
                  evidence base for implementing genomic prediction in
                  grapevine breeding.},

                  veterinary importance, and represent an increasing
                  threat for human and animal health. Important steps
                  in assessing disease risk and developing possible
                  new future control strategies involve identifying
                  tick-borne microbes, their temporal dynamics and
                  interactions.Methods Using high throughput
                  sequencing, we studied the microbiota dynamics of
                  Ixodes ricinus from 371 nymphs collected monthly
                  over three consecutive years in a peri-urban
                  forest. After adjusting a Poisson Log Normal model
                  to our data set, the implementation of a principal
                  component analysis as well as sparse network
                  reconstruction and differential analysis allowed us
                  to assess inter-annual, seasonal and monthly
                  variability of I. ricinus microbial communities as
                  well as their interactions.Results Around 75\% of
                  the detected sequences belonged to five genera known
                  to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods
                  and potentially circulating in ticks: Candidatus
                  Midichloria, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma, Arsenophonus
                  and Wolbachia. The structure of the I. ricinus
                  microbiota was temporally variable with interannual
                  recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs
                  belonging to environmental genera. The total network
                  analysis revealed a majority of positive (partial)
                  correlations. We identified strong relationships
                  between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and
                  Arsenophonus, betraying the presence of the
                  parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks, and
                  the well known arthropod symbiont Spiroplasma,
                  previously documented to be involved in the defense
                  against parasitoid wasp in Drosophila
                  melanogaster. Other associations were observed
                  between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and
                  pathogens belonging to Rickettsia, probably
                  Rickettsia helvetica. More specific network analysis
                  finally suggested that the presence of pathogens
                  belonging to genera Borrelia, Anaplasma and
                  Rickettsia might disrupt microbial interactions in
                  I. ricinus.Conclusions Here, we identified the
                  I. ricinus microbiota and documented for the first
                  time the existence and recurrence of marked temporal
                  shifts in the tick microbial community dynamics. We
                  statistically showed strong relationships between
                  the presence of some pathogens and the structure of
                  the I. ricinus non-pathogenic microbes. We
                  interestingly detected close links between some tick
                  symbionts and the potential presence of either
                  pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks. All
                  these new findings might be very promising for the

  ABSTRACT =	 {Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDM) provide a
                  general multivariate framework to study the joint
                  abundances of all species from a community. JSDM
                  account for both structuring factors (environmental
                  characteristics or gradients, such as habitat type
                  or nutrient availability) and potential interactions
                  between the species (competition, mutualism,
                  parasitism, etc.), which is instrumental in
                  disentangling meaningful ecological interactions
                  from mere statistical associations. Modeling the
                  dependency between the species is challenging
                  because of the count-valued nature of abundance data
                  and most JSDM rely on Gaussian latent layer to
                  encode the dependencies between species in a
                  covariance matrix. The multivariate
                  Poisson-lognormal (PLN) model is one such model,
                  which can be viewed as a multivariate mixed Poisson
                  regression model. Inferring such models raises both
                  statistical and computational issues, many of which
                  were solved in recent contributions using
                  variational techniques and convex optimization
                  tools. The PLN model turns out to be a versatile
                  framework, within which a variety of analyses can be
                  performed, including multivariate sample comparison,
                  clustering of sites or samples, dimension reduction
                  (ordination) for visualization purposes, or
                  inferring interaction networks. This paper presents
                  the general PLN framework and illustrates its use on
                  a series a typical experimental datasets. All the
                  models and methods are implemented in the

  abstract =	 {In many cancers, mechanisms of gene regulation can
                  be severely altered. Identification of deregulated
                  genes, which do not follow the regulation processes
                  that exist between transcription factors and their
                  target genes, is of importance to better understand
                  the development of the disease. We propose a
                  methodology to detect deregulation mechanisms with a
                  particular focus on cancer subtypes. This strategy
                  is based on the comparison between tumoral and
                  healthy cells. First, we use gene expression data
                  from healthy cells to infer a reference gene
                  regulatory network. Then, we compare it with gene
                  expression levels in tumor samples to detect
                  deregulated target genes. We finally measure the
                  ability of each transcription factor to explain
                  these deregulations. We apply our method on a public
                  bladder cancer data set derived from The Cancer
                  Genome Atlas project and confirm that it captures
                  hallmarks of cancer subtypes. We also show that it
                  enables the discovery of new potential biomarkers. },
