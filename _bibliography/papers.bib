        Survey (KURVS), aimed at studying the outer rotation curves
        shape and dark matter content of 22 star-forming galaxies at
        z $\sim$ 1.5. These galaxies represent
        'typical' star-forming discs at z $\sim$ 1.5, being located within the
        star-forming main sequence and stellar mass-size relation with
        stellar masses 9.5 ≤ log(M<sub>★</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub>) ≤ 11.5.
	We use the spatially resolved Hα emission to extract
	individual rotation
        curves out to 4 times the effective radius, on average, or
        $\sim$ 10-15 kpc. Most rotation curves
        are flat or rising between three and six disc scale radii. Only
        three objects with dispersion-dominated dynamics
        (v<sub>rot</sub>/σ<sub>0</sub> $\sim$ 0.2)
        have declining outer
        rotation curves at more than 5σ
        significance. After accounting for seeing and pressure support,
        the nine rotation-dominated discs with
        v<sub>rot</sub>/σ<sub>0</sub> ≥ 1.5
        have average dark matter fractions of 50±20 per cent
	at the effective radius, similar to local discs.
        Together with previous observations of star-forming galaxies at
        cosmic noon, our measurements suggest a trend of declining dark
        matter fraction with increasing stellar mass and stellar mass
        surface density at the effective radius. Measurements of
        simulated EAGLE galaxies are in quantitative agreement with
        observations up to log(M<sub>★</sub> R<sub>eff</sub><sup>-2</sup>
        /M<sub>⊙</sub> kpc<sup>-2</sup>) $\sim$ 9.2, and overpredict the
        dark matter fraction of galaxies with higher mass surface
        densities by a factor of $\sim$ 3. We
        conclude that the dynamics of typical rotationally-supported
        discs at z $\sim$ 1.5 is dominated by
        dark matter from effective radius scales, in broad agreement
        with cosmological models. The tension with observations at high
        stellar mass surface density suggests that the prescriptions for
        baryonic processes occurring in the most massive galaxies (such
        as bulge growth and quenching) need to be reassessed.}",

        should be identical everywhere provided it is sampled in
        sufficiently large volumes, implying that the same should be
        true of the HI WF. The Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) 21-cm
        survey measured the HI WF in northern and southern Galactic
        fields and found a systematically higher number density in the
        north. At face value, this is in tension with theoretical
        predictions. We use the Sibelius-DARK N-body simulation and the
        semi-analytical galaxy formation model GALFORM to create a mock
        ALFALFA survey. We find that the offset in number density has
        two origins: the sensitivity of the survey is different in the
        two fields, which has not been correctly accounted for in
        previous measurements; and the 1/V<sub>eff</sub> algorithm used for
        completeness corrections does not fully account for biases
        arising from spatial clustering in the galaxy distribution. The
        latter is primarily driven by a foreground overdensity in the
        northern field within 30 Mpc, but more distant
        structure also plays a role. We provide updated measurements of
        the ALFALFA HI WF (and HI mass function) correcting for the
        variations in survey sensitivity. Only when systematic effects
        such as these are understood and corrected for can cosmological

        visualizations to guide an assessment of how many galaxies are
        likely to be strongly perturbed by processes in several
        categories: mergers/interactions (affecting 6/33 galaxies), bulk

        for rapid infall quenching to maintain the bimodality in the SFR
        of cluster galaxies; the depth of the green valley prefers
        quenching onsets close to first pericentre and a longer
        quenching envelope, in slight tension with the MWA-driven
        results. Taken together these results suggest that quenching
        begins close to, or just after pericentre, but the time-scale

        ram-pressure stripping is not complete on first pericentric

        formation model: one where supernova-driven gas flows
        redistribute dark matter and form constant-density central
        'cores', and another where the central 'cusps' survive intact.
        We 'observe' each galaxy along multiple sightlines and derive a

        ring approach to model the gas kinematics. We find that the

        the recovered rotation curve and the actual circular velocity
        curve driven primarily by (i) non-circular gas orbits within the
        discs; (ii) the finite thickness of gaseous discs, which leads
        to overlap of different radii in projection; and (iii)
        departures from dynamical equilibrium. Dwarfs with dark matter
        cusps often appear to have a core, whilst the inverse error is
        less common. These effects naturally reproduce an observed trend
        which other models struggle to explain: late-type dwarfs with
        more steeply rising rotation curves appear to be dark matter-
        dominated in the inner regions, whereas the opposite seems to
        hold in galaxies with core-like rotation curves. We conclude
        that if similar effects affect the rotation curves of observed

        sizeable dark matter cores is most likely incompatible with

        alone. We show that a standard cold dark matter halo that
        follows the concentration-halo mass relation fails to reproduce
        the amplitude of the rotation curve by a large margin. Only a
        halo with an extremely (and arguably unfeasible) low
        concentration reaches agreement with the data. We also find that
        the rotation curve of AGC 114905 deviates strongly from the
        predictions of modified Newtonian dynamics. The inclination of
        the galaxy, which is measured independently from our modelling,
        remains the largest uncertainty in our analysis, but the
        associated errors are not large enough to reconcile the galaxy
        with the expectations of cold dark matter or modified Newtonian
        dynamics.}",

        data release of the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey.
        The number density of sources as a function of their neutral
        hydrogen masses - the HI mass function (HIMF) - has
        previously been reported to have a significantly different low-
        mass slope and 'knee mass' in the two sky regions surveyed
        during ALFALFA. In contrast with this, we find that the shape of
        the HIWF in the same two sky regions is remarkably similar,
        consistent with being identical within the confidence intervals
        implied by the data (but the overall normalization differs). The
        spatial uniformity of the HIWF implies that it is likely a
        stable tracer of the mass function of dark matter haloes, in
        spite of the environmental processes to which the measured

        previously overlooked systematic error affecting the HIWF,
        which may plausibly see its low-velocity slope steepen by
        $\sim$ 40 per cent in analyses of

     abstract = "{Context. The star formation in galaxies in present-day clusters has
        almost entirely been shut down, but the exact mechanism that
        quenched these galaxies is still uncertain. Aims:
        By tracing the orbital and star formation histories of galaxies
        within the Coma cluster, we seek to understand the role of the
        high-density cluster environment in quenching these galaxies.
        Methods: We combine star formation histories
        extracted from high-signal-to-noise spectra of 11 early-type
        galaxies around the center of the Coma cluster with probability
        distributions for their orbital parameters obtained using an
        N-body simulation to connect their orbital and star formation
        histories. Results: We find that all 11 galaxies
        likely quenched near their first pericentric approach. Higher
        stellar mass galaxies
        (log(M<sub>★</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub>) >
        10) had formed a higher fraction of their stellar mass (more
        than $\sim$ 90\%) than their lower mass counterparts
        ($\sim$ 80-90\%) by the time they
        fell into the cluster (when they cross 2.5r<sub>vir</sub>). We find
        that the expected infall occurred around z $\sim$
        0.6, followed by the first pericentric passage
        $\sim$ 4 Gyr later. Galaxies in our sample formed a
        significant fraction of their stellar mass, up to 15\%, between
        infall and first pericenter, and had assembled more than
        $\sim$ 98\% of their cumulative stellar mass by
        first pericenter. Conclusions: Unlike previous
        low-redshift studies that suggest that star formation continues
        until about first apocenter or later, the high percentage of
        stellar mass already formed by first pericenter in our sample
        galaxies points to star formation ceasing within a gigayear
        after the first pericentric passage. We consider the possible
        physical mechanisms driving quenching and find that our results
        resemble the situation in clusters at z $\sim$ 1,
        where active stripping of gas (ram-pressure or tidally driven)
        seems to be required to quench satellites by their first
        pericentric passage. However, a larger sample will be required
        to conclusively account for the unknown fraction of preprocessed
        satellites in the Coma cluster.}",

        lensing measurements from the fourth data release of the Kilo-
        Degree Survey (KiDS-1000). These measurements extend the radial
        acceleration relation (RAR), traditionally measured using galaxy
        rotation curves, by 2 decades in g<sub>obs</sub> into the low-
        acceleration regime beyond the outskirts of the observable
        galaxy. We compare our RAR measurements to the predictions of
        two modified gravity (MG) theories: modified Newtonian dynamics
        and Verlinde's emergent gravity (EG). We find that the measured
        relation between g<sub>obs</sub> and g<sub>bar</sub> agrees well with the MG
        predictions. In addition, we find a difference of at least
        6σ between the RARs of early- and late-type
        galaxies (split by S{\'e}rsic index and u-r
        colour) with the same stellar mass. Current MG theories involve
        a gravity modification that is independent of other galaxy
        properties, which would be unable to explain this behaviour,

        MICE, a ΛCDM simulation with hybrid halo
        occupation distribution modelling and abundance matching,
        reproduces the observed RAR but significantly differs from
        BAHAMAS, a hydrodynamical cosmological galaxy formation
        simulation. Our results are sensitive to the amount of
        circumgalactic gas; current observational constraints indicate
        that the resulting corrections are likely moderate. Measurements
        of the lensing RAR with future cosmological surveys (such as
        Euclid) will be able to further distinguish between MG and
        ΛCDM models if systematic uncertainties in
        the baryonic mass distribution around galaxies are reduced.}",

        massive (M<sub>vir</sub> $\sim$ 10<sup>14.5</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>) clusters

        good agreement with previous work. Interestingly, the stellar
        distribution (or intracluster light, ICL) also has a well-
        defined edge, which is directly related to the splashback radius
        of the halo. Thus, detecting the edge of the ICL can provide an
        independent measure of the physical boundary of the halo, and
        the recent mass accretion rate. We show that these caustics can
        also be seen in the projected density profiles, but care must be
        taken to account for the influence of substructures and other
        non-diffuse material, which can bias and/or weaken the signal of
        the steepest slope. This is particularly important for the
        stellar material, which has a higher fraction bound in subhaloes
        than the dark matter. Finally, we show that the 'stellar
        splashback' feature is located beyond current observational
        constraints on the ICL, but these large projected distances
        (≫1 Mpc) and low surface brightnesses
        (μ ≫ 32 mag arcsec<sup>-2</sup>) can
        be reached with upcoming observational facilities such as the
        Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Space

        us to investigate cusps and cores in density distributions. We
        find that, for CDM dwarfs, the recovered enclosed mass profiles
        have a bias of no more than 10 per cent, with a 50 per cent
        scatter in the inner regions and a 20 per cent scatter near the
        half-light radius, consistent with standard mass estimators. The
        density profiles are also recovered with a bias of no more than
        10 per cent and a scatter of 30 per cent in the inner regions.
        For SIDM dwarfs, the mass and density profiles are recovered
        within our 95 per cent confidence intervals but are biased
        towards cuspy dark matter distributions. This is mainly due to a
        lack of sufficient constraints from the data. We explore the
        sources of scatter in the accuracy of the recovered profiles and
        suggest a χ<sup>2</sup> statistic to separate
        successful models from biased ones. Finally, we show that the
        uncertainties on the mass profiles obtained with GravSphere are
        smaller than those for comparable Jeans methods and that they
        can be further improved if stronger priors, motivated by
        cosmological simulations, are placed on the velocity anisotropy.

        outliers from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), as they
        rotate much slower than expected given their baryonic mass, and
        to have a baryon fraction similar to the cosmological mean. By

        low star formation rate surface densities, and as a result they
        did not eject significant amounts of gas out of their discs. At

        remarkably little scatter, implying that the dynamics of a
        system can be predicted simply by measuring its density profile
        as traced by e.g. stellar light or gas emission lines. Extending
        the relation to accelerations below those usually probed by
        practically observable kinematic tracers is challenging,
        especially once accounting for faintly emitting baryons, such as
        the putative warm-hot intergalactic medium, becomes important.
        We show that in the low-acceleration regime, the (inverted) RAR
        predicts an unphysical, declining enclosed baryonic mass profile

        curve shape correlates with baryonic surface density: high
        surface density galaxies have rapidly rising rotation curves
        consistent with cuspy cold dark matter haloes; slowly rising
        rotation curves (characteristic of galaxies with inner mass
        deficits or 'cores') occur only in low surface density galaxies.
        The correlation, however, seems too weak to be the main driver

        trend, from 'cuspy' systems where baryons are unimportant in the
        inner mass budget to 'cored' galaxies where baryons actually
        dominate. This trend constrains the various scenarios proposed

        analytic expression that relates the baryonic distribution to

        roughly 1.3, 2, and 4 at radial distances of 20, 8, and 1 kpc,
        respectively compared to an uncontracted halo. Ignoring this

        velocity distributions of subhaloes are also affected by the
        presence of the galaxy, much more so in AURIGA than in APOSTLE.
        The differences on subhalo properties in the two simulations can
        be traced back to the mass of the central galaxies, which in
        AURIGA are typically twice as massive as those in APOSTLE. We
        show that some of the results from previous studies are
        inaccurate due to systematic errors in the modelling of subhalo
        orbits near the centre of haloes.}",

        reconcile the direction of motion of stream members with the
        stream arc, resolving a puzzling mismatch reported in earlier
        work. We use N-body simulations to show that the stream is
        likely only on its second pericentric passage, and thus was
        formed recently. The simulations suggest that most of the
        disrupted progenitor is visible in the observed stream today,
        and that little further tidal debris is expected to lie beyond
        the ends of the stream. The luminosity, length, width, and
        velocity dispersion of the stream suggest a globular cluster
        (GC) progenitor substantially fainter and of lower surface
        brightness than estimated in previous work, and unlike any other
        known globulars in the Galaxy. This result suggests the
        existence of clusters that would extend the known GC population
        to fainter and more weakly bound systems than hitherto known.
        How such a weakly bound cluster of old stars survived until it
        was disrupted so recently, however, remains a mystery.
        Integrating backwards in time, we find that the orbits of
        Sagittarius and Ophiuchus passed within $\sim$ 5 kpc

        poor population. In this work we discuss mechanisms that lead to
        the formation of two spatially segregated metallicity
        populations. Using a set of high-resolution hydrodynamical
        simulations of Local Group-like environments, we select a sample
        of satellite and field galaxies, spanning the stellar mass range
        10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, that exhibit
        bimodality in their metallicity distributions. Among those, we
        identify a subsample with a strong spatial segregation in the
        two populations. We find three distinct mechanisms for their
        formation. In field dwarfs and in a small fraction of
        satellites, a merger causes the metal-poor stars to migrate to
        larger radii and encourages the available gas to sink to the
        centre of the dwarf. Most of the gas is subsequently blown out
        of the halo through star formation feedback, but the remaining
        gas is consumed in the formation of a metal-rich population. In
        the exclusive case of satellites that have retained some of
        their gas at infall, it is the compression of this gas by ram
        pressure near pericentre that triggers the formation of metal-
        rich stars, whilst simultaneously preventing star formation at
        larger radii through stripping. Additionally, in a small number
        of field and satellite dwarfs, interactions with gaseous
        filaments and other galaxies can result in the formation of a
        metal-rich population. Regardless of the formation mechanism, a

        simulations of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes. It has been
        suggested that this conflict could be resolved by fluctuations
        in the inner gravitational potential caused by the periodic
        removal of gas following bursts of star formation. Earlier work
        has suggested that core formation requires a bursty and extended

        formation at any mass or any correlation between the inner slope
        of the DM density profile and temporal variations in the SFH.
        APOSTLE and AURIGA dwarfs display a similar diversity in their
        cumulative SFHs to available data for Local Group dwarfs. Dwarfs
        in both simulations are DM-dominated on all resolved scales at
        all times, likely limiting the ability of gas outflows to alter
        significantly the central density profiles of their haloes. We
        conclude that recurrent bursts of star formation are not

        Hδ-strong (HDS) galaxies (HDSGs)
        are rare, making up only $\sim$ 2\% (25/1220) of
        galaxies with stellar mass log(M<sub>★</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub>) > 10. The HDSGs make up a
        significant fraction of nonpassive cluster galaxies (15\%;
        17/115) and a smaller fraction (2.0\%; 8/387) of the nonpassive
        population in low-density environments. The majority (9/17) of
        cluster HDSGs show evidence of star formation at their centers,
        with the HDS regions found in the outer parts of the galaxy.
        Conversely, the HDS signal is more evenly spread across the
        galaxy for the majority (6/8) of HDSGs in low-density

        Λ cold dark matter cosmological
        hydrodynamical simulations. The modelling yields a large
        diversity of rotation curves for an individual galaxy at fixed
        inclination, depending on the line-of-sight orientation. The
        diversity is driven by non-circular motions in the gas; in
        particular, by strong bisymmetric fluctuations in the azimuthal
        velocities that the tilted-ring model is ill-suited to account
        for and that are difficult to detect in model residuals. Large
        misestimates of the circular velocity arise when the kinematic
        major axis coincides with the extrema of the fluctuation
        pattern, in some cases mimicking the presence of kiloparsec-
        scale density `cores', when none are actually present. The
        thickness of APOSTLE discs compounds this effect: more slowly
        rotating extra-planar gas systematically reduces the average
        line-of-sight speeds. The recovered rotation curves thus tend to
        underestimate the true circular velocity of APOSTLE galaxies in

        such as DDO 47 and DDO 87, where the model residuals suggest
        that such motions might have affected estimates of the inner
        circular velocities. Although residuals from tilted-ring models
        in the simulations appear larger than in observed galaxies, our

        with decreasing halo mass and essentially vanishes in haloes
        with maximum circular velocities V<sub>max</sub> < 20-30 km s<sup>-1</sup>.
        Dark-matter-dominated dwarfs should therefore have
        characteristic velocities of about that value, unless they are
        small enough to probe only the rising part of the halo circular
        velocity curve (i.e. half-mass radii, r<sub>1/2</sub>
        ≪ 1 kpc). Many dwarfs have properties in
        disagreement with this prediction: they are large enough to
        probe their halo V<sub>max</sub> but their characteristic velocities
        are well below 20 km s<sup>-1</sup>. These 'cold faint giants' (an
        extreme example is the recently discovered Crater 2 Milky Way

        satellite galaxies, lowering their accelerations below the

        scattering off giant molecular clouds, radial migration driven
        by spiral patterns, or orbital resonances with a bar. Secular
        processes play a minor role in the simulated galaxy, which lacks

        a result of the gradual enrichment of a gaseous disc that is

        centrifugal equilibrium. The settling is controlled by the
        feedback of young stars; which links the star formation,
        enrichment, and equilibration time-scales, inducing radial and
        vertical gradients in the gaseous disc and its descendent stars.
        The kinematics of coeval stars evolve little after birth and
        provide a faithful snapshot of the gaseous disc structure at the

        half-light radius and the total mass enclosed within the half-

        simulations of the Local Group to test the validity and accuracy
        of such mass estimators for both dispersion and rotation-
        supported galaxies, for field and satellite galaxies, and for
        galaxies of varying masses, shapes and velocity dispersion
        anisotropies. We find that the mass estimators of Walker et al.

        dominated systems with little systematic bias, but with a
        1σ scatter of 25 and 23 per cent,

        the impact of the 3D shape of the stellar mass distribution,

        galaxy formation models. It is steeper than the M ∝ V<sup>3</sup> scaling relating halo virial
        masses and circular velocities and its zero-point implies that
        galaxies comprise a very small fraction of available baryons.
        Such low galaxy formation efficiencies may, in principle, be
        explained by winds driven by evolving stars, but the tightness
        of the BTF relation argues against the substantial scatter
        expected from such a vigorous feedback mechanism. We use the
        APOSTLE/EAGLE simulations to show that the BTF relation is well
        reproduced in Λcold dark matter (CDM)
        simulations that match the size and number of galaxies as a
        function of stellar mass. In such models, galaxy rotation
        velocities are proportional to halo virial velocity and the
        steep velocity-mass dependence results from the decline in
        galaxy formation efficiency with decreasing halo mass needed to
        reconcile the CDM halo mass function with the galaxy luminosity
        function. The scatter in the simulated BTF is smaller than
        observed, even when considering all simulated galaxies and not
        just rotationally supported ones. The simulations predict that
        the BTF should become increasingly steep at the faint end,
        although the velocity scatter at fixed mass should remain small.
        Observed galaxies with rotation speeds below
        $\sim$ 40 km s<sup>-1</sup> seem to deviate from this

        correlates strongly and with little scatter with halo mass,
        dropping steadily towards dwarf galaxies. The baryonic mass of a
        galaxy may thus be used to place a lower limit on total halo
        mass and, consequently, on its asymptotic maximum circular
        velocity. A number of observed dwarfs seem to violate this
        constraint, having baryonic masses up to 10 times higher than
        expected from their rotation speeds, or, alternatively, rotating
        at only half the speed expected for their mass. Taking the data
        at face value, either these systems have formed galaxies with
        extraordinary efficiency - highly unlikely given their shallow
        potential wells - or their dark matter content is much lower

        important role by gradually removing dark matter from the

        systems of larger-than-average size for their luminosity. Our
        models suggest that tides have significantly reduced the dark

        of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda satellite populations appear
        to be in disagreement with N-body simulations of the `lambda
        cold dark matter' (ΛCDM) model: there are
        far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in CDM haloes
        (the `missing satellites' problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid
        the most massive substructures (the `too-big-to-fail' problem);
        and the brightest satellites appear to orbit their host galaxies
        on a thin plane (the `planes of satellites' problem). Here we
        present results from APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local
        Environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
        of 12 volumes selected to match the kinematics of the Local

        environment, we find that our simulations match the observed

        the MW and Andromeda. Due to changes to the structure of haloes
        and the evolution in the LG environment, the simulations
        reproduce the observed relation between stellar mass and
        velocity dispersion of individual dwarf spheroidal galaxies
        without necessitating the formation of cores in their dark

        anisotropies, including one similar to the MWs, confirming that
        such a configuration is not unexpected in

        work, that the separation and approach velocity of the Milky Way
        (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies favour a total mass for the
        pair of $\sim$ 5×10<sup>12</sup>
        M<sub>⊙</sub>. A mass this large, however, is
        difficult to reconcile with the small relative tangential
        velocity of the pair, as well as with the small deceleration
        from the Hubble flow observed for the most distant LG members.
        Halo pairs that match these three criteria have average masses a
        factor of $\sim$ 2 times smaller than suggested by
        the timing argument, but with large dispersion. Guided by these
        results, we have selected 12 halo pairs with total mass in the

        hydrodynamical simulations from the EAGLE and LOCAL GROUPS

        rotation curves of galaxies spanning a wide range in mass. The
        shape of the circular velocity profiles of simulated galaxies
        varies systematically as a function of galaxy mass, but shows
        remarkably little variation at fixed maximum circular velocity.
        This is especially true for low-mass dark-matter-dominated
        systems, reflecting the expected similarity of the underlying
        CDM haloes. This is at odds with observed dwarf galaxies, which
        show a large diversity of rotation curve shapes, even at fixed
        maximum rotation speed. Some dwarfs have rotation curves that
        agree well with simulations, others do not. The latter are
        systems where the inferred mass enclosed in the inner regions is
        much lower than expected for CDM haloes and include many
        galaxies where previous work claims the presence of a constant

        characterized as an `inner mass deficit' problem than as a

        dark matter is more complex than envisaged by any current model;
        (ii) current simulations fail to reproduce the diversity in the

        galaxies. Models in which the bulge stellar populations depend
        only on the galaxy subhalo mass while the disc is quenched upon
        infall are acceptable fits to the data. An exponential disc
        quenching time-scale of 3-3.5 Gyr is preferred. Quenching in
        lower mass groups prior to infall (`pre-processing') provides
        better fits, with similar quenching time-scales. Models with

        work) difficult. The present-day phase space coordinates of a
        satellite galaxy carry information about its orbital history,
        which can then be compared to its star formation history (SFH).
        This is expected to reveal both a trigger time and timescale for
        environmental quenching. Finally, this can be related back to
        the physical process(es) regulating star formation in high
        density environments. We use merger trees from the MultiDark Run
        1 N-body simulation to compile a catalogue of satellite orbits
        in cluster environments. We parameterize the orbital history by
        the time since crossing within 2.5 virial radii of the cluster
        centre and use our catalogue to estimate the probability density
        over a range of this parameter given a set of projected phase
        space coordinates. We show that different populations of
        satellite haloes occupy (semi-)distinct regions of (projected)
        phase space. We generalize this result by producing a
        probability distribution function (PDF) of possible infall times
        at every point in projected phase space. We apply our method to
        determining the infall time PDFs of a large sample of observed
        cluster satellite candidates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
        We use galaxy colour as a proxy for SFH and model the
        distribution of satellite galaxy colours as two gaussian
        populations. We derive a Markov chain Monte-Carlo method to
        obtain the colour distribution as a function of the time since
        infall into the cluster environment. Our implementation of this
        method is still being tuned, but we use a second simpler (but
        much cruder) method to obtain an estimate of the evolution of
        the colour distribution. Our results are suggestive of a
        quenching process that begins within perhaps ±1
        Gyr of virial radius crossing and which slows after pericentric
        passage. We stress that results obtained with this second method
        come with important caveats.}",
