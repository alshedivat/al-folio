  title={The ozone-water complex: CCSD(T)/CBS structures and anharmonic vibrational spectroscopy of O<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>, (n=1-2)},
  author={Hui, W.C.H. and Lemke, K.H.},
  abstract={Ozone–water complexes O3(H2O)n (n=1–2) have been studied using coupled cluster theory with triple excitations CCSD(T) with correlation consistent basis sets aug-cc-pVnZ (n = D, T, Q) and complete basis set (CBS) extrapolation techniques. We identified seven dimer (n = 1) and nine trimer species (n = 2) with open C2v and cyclic D3h ozone. Calculations at the CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory for C2v O3(H2O) on the counterpoise (CP)-corrected potential energy surface yield a dissociation energy of De = 2.31 kcal/mol and an O3 central-oxygen (Oc) H2O oxygen (Ow) distance r[Oc⋯Ow] of 3.097 Å, which is in good agreement with an experimental value of 2.957 Å [J. Z. Gillies et al., J. Mol. Spectrosc. 146, 493 (1991)]. Combining our CCSD(T)/CBS value of De for C2v O3(H2O) with our best estimate anharmonic CCSD(T)/aVTZ ΔZPE yields a Do value of 1.82 kcal/mol; the CCSD(T)/CBS value of De for D3h O3(H2O) is 1.51 kcal/mol and yields an anharmonic CCSD(T)/aVTZ Do = 0.99 kcal/mol. CCSD(T)/aVTZ dissociation energies and structures for C2v O3(H2O)2 are De = 4.15 kcal/mol, (Do = 3.08 kcal/mol) and r[Oc⋯Ow] = 2.973 Å, and De = 2.64 kcal/mol (Do = 1.68 kcal/mol) with r[Oc⋯Ow] = 2.828 Å for D3h O3(H2O)2. The results from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which consider dynamic and thermal effects in O3(H2O), show that the O3(H2O) complex remains stable at 50 K and dynamically interconverts between two hydrogen-bonded conformers with short Oc⋯Ow contacts (3.85 Å). Carr–Parrinello molecular dynamic (CPMD) simulations for O3(H2O) and O3(H2O)2 at 100 K demonstrate that O3(H2O)2 remains structurally intact, whereas O3(H2O) dissociates to free ozone and water, a feature consistent with the larger average binding energy in O3(H2O)2 (2.2 kcal/mol) vs that in O3(H2O) (1.8 kcal/mol). Finally, the results from CCSD(T)/CBS and CPMD simulations demonstrate that the large inter-trimer binding energies in O3(H2O)2 would give rise to an elevated trimer/dimer population ratio, making O3(H2O)2 a particularly stable and spectroscopically detectable complex.},

  title={Structure and solvation dynamics of the hydroxide ion in ice-like water clusters: a CCSD(T) and car–parrinello molecular dynamics study},
  author={Lemke, K.H.},
  abstract={Using MP2, CCSD(T) electronic structure theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the structure, solvation dynamics and vibrational spectra of OH−(H2O)n clusters. Our study reports new cubic and fused cubic global minima structures of OH−(H2O)n for n = 8–26 with surface and interior solvation arrangements. In the case of OH−(H2O)26, we show that MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations predict global minima structures with the hydroxide ion occupying the interior region of a densely packed cubic cluster that is secured by ionic hydrogen bonds. More importantly, results from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of OH−(H2O)26 demonstrate that the hydroxide ion remains in the cluster interior and hexa-coordinated, irrespective of the temperature, up to around 175 K, then incrementally transitions from a surface-exposed penta- (170–200 K), to a tetra- (225 K) to a tri-coordinated OH−(H2O)3 structure at 300 K. Building on our temperature-dependent vibrational power spectra, we are also able to disentangle structure and temperature effects on individual spectral contributions arising from water molecules located in the inner and outer shell of OH−(H2O)26. Some of these theoretical results provide valuable guidance for the interpretation of IRMPD spectra of small hydroxide-water clusters, but there are also several intriguing implications of these results, in particular, for the solvation of the OH− ion at the surface of water nanodroplets and aqueous interfaces.},

  title={Molecular clusters and solvation in volcanic and hydrothermal vapors},
  author={Lemke, K.H. and Seward T.M.},
  abstract={In this chapter, we present new data on the molecular structure of steam and water vapor and discussed various aspects of evolving cluster geometry and size as a function of temperature. We have then considered proton solvation in water vapor and shown that the hydronium ion occupies a surface coordinated position on water clusters which leads to an “acidic” nano-layer overlying a given molecular water cluster. New data on the ion-product constant of water vapor as a function of cluster size and temperature are also presented and this further encourages consideration of the molecular framework with which to consider the pH of water vapor at high temperatures. We note, for example, the values (Table 1) of pKw(500K) ranging from 3.2 to 6.0 for water cluster sizes (n=10–45) in comparison to the liquid water value of pKw(500K)=11.2.},

  title={Structure and binding energy of the H<sub>2</sub>S dimer at the CCSD(T) complete basis set limit},
  author={Lemke, K.H.},
  abstract={This study presents results for the binding energy and geometry of the H2S dimer which have been computed using Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2, MP4) and coupled cluster (CCSD, CCSD(T)) calculations with basis sets up to aug-cc-pV5Z. Estimates of De, EZPE, Do, and dimer geometry have been obtained at each level of theory by taking advantage of the systematic convergence behavior toward the complete basis set (CBS) limit. The CBS limit binding energy values of De are 1.91 (MP2), 1.75 (MP4), 1.41 (CCSD), and 1.69 kcal/mol (CCSD[T]). The most accurate values for the equilibrium S-S distance rSS (without counterpoise correction) are 4.080 (MP2/aug-cc-pV5Z), 4.131 (MP4/aug-cc-pVQZ), 4.225 (CCSD/aug-cc-pVQZ), and 4.146 Å (CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ). This study also evaluates the effect of counterpoise correction on the H2S dimer geometry and binding energy. As regards the structure of (H2S)2, MPn, CCSD, and CCSD(T) level values of rSS, obtained by performing geometry optimizations on the counterpoise-corrected potential energy surface, converge systematically to CBS limit values of 4.099 (MP2), 4.146 (MP4), 4.233 (CCSD), and 4.167 Å (CCSD(T)). The corresponding CBS limit values of the equilibrium binding energy De are 1.88 (MP2), 1.76 (MP4), 1.41 (CCSD), and 1.69 kcal/mol (CCSD(T)), the latter in excellent agreement with the measured binding energy value of 1.68 ± 0.02 kcal/mol reported by Ciaffoni et al. [Appl. Phys. B 92, 627 (2008)]. Combining CBS electronic binding energies De with EZPE predicted by CCSD(T) vibrational second-order perturbation theory calculations yields Do = 1.08 kcal/mol, which is around 0.6 kcal/mol smaller than the measured value of 1.7 ± 0.3 kcal/mol. Overall, the results presented here demonstrate that the application of high level calculations, in particular CCSD(T), in combination with augmented correlation consistent basis sets provides valuable insight into the structure and energetics of the hydrogen sulfide dimer.},

  author={Lemke, K.H. and Seward T.M.},
  abstract={The M06-2X and B2PLYP-D functionals have been applied to predict structures and energies for (CO2)n clusters up to n = 16. A comparison between M06-2X, B2PLYP-D and benchmark CCSD(T) results indicates that M06-2X is capable of providing accurate binding energies. Stepwise M06-2X (CO2)n clustering free energies exhibit a sharp discontinuity at the magic cluster size n = 13 and systematically shift to more exergonic values with decreasing temperature, in particular for larger clusters. These results indicate that the M06-2X method provides an accurate and cost effective description of non-covalent interactions in (CO2)n clusters and therefore may provide important information on CO2 nucleation phenomena.},
