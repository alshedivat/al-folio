    Due to the rapid progress of virtual reality hardware, these technologies are no longer niche products.
    Together with the much easier access to open geodata, new possibilities for procedural visualizations have opened up, 
    combining Virtual Reality and GIS (VRGIS) technologies. In this bachelor thesis a prototypical implementation of a modern VRGIS software is presented, 
    including concepts for movement,orientation and visualization of data. Due to the programming with the game engine Godot, as well as OpenVR,
    the developed software is almost exclusively based on open-source solutions. As with classic GIS software, the focus is on landscape and spatial planning.
    VRGIS is intended to simplify the communication process. To understand the possible advantages, users and application areas of VRGIS, 
    six expert interviews were conducted. The questions focused on the following areas: 
    The workﬂow of the expert; potential tools/beneﬁts of VRGIS; Experiences in the ﬁeld of 3D/VR in GIS; 
    experiences in the ﬁeld of open-source software and open-data; the importance of GIS to communicate research results. 
    Together with a comprehensive literature research, this also revealed completely new areas such as 
    historical landscape visualization, virtual tourism, or emergency training.},
