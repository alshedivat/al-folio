  abstract = {Self-supervised methods have recently proved to be nearly as effective as supervised methods in various imaging inverse problems, paving the way for learning-based methods in scientific and medical imaging applications where ground truth data is hard or expensive to obtain. This is the case in magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. These methods critically rely on invariance to translations and/or rotations of the image distribution to learn from incomplete measurement data alone. However, existing approaches fail to obtain competitive performances in the problems of image super-resolution and deblurring, which play a key role in most imaging systems. In this work, we show that invariance to translations and rotations is insufficient to learn from measurements that only contain low-frequency information. Instead, we propose a new self-supervised approach that leverages the fact that many image distributions are approximately scale-invariant, and that can be applied to any inverse problem where high-frequency information is lost in the measurement process. We demonstrate throughout a series of experiments on real datasets that the proposed method outperforms other self-supervised approaches, and obtains performances on par with fully supervised learning.},

  abstract = {Plug-and-play algorithms constitute a popular framework for solving inverse imaging problems that rely on the implicit definition of an image prior via a denoiser. These algorithms can leverage powerful pre-trained denoisers to solve a wide range of imaging tasks, circumventing the necessity to train models on a per-task basis. Unfortunately, plug-and-play methods often show unstable behaviors, hampering their promise of versatility and leading to suboptimal quality of reconstructed images. In this work, we show that enforcing equivariance to certain groups of transformations (rotations, reflections, and/or translations) on the denoiser strongly improves the stability of the algorithm as well as its reconstruction quality. We provide a theoretical analysis that illustrates the role of equivariance on better performance and stability. We present a simple algorithm that enforces equivariance on any existing denoiser by simply applying a random transformation to the input of the denoiser and the inverse transformation to the output at each iteration of the algorithm. Experiments on multiple imaging modalities and denoising networks show that the equivariant plug-and-play algorithm improves both the reconstruction performance and the stability compared to their non-equivariant counterparts.},

  abstract = {Scientific imaging problems are often severely ill-posed, and hence have significant intrinsic uncertainty. Accurately quantifying the uncertainty in the solutions to such problems is therefore critical for the rigorous interpretation of experimental results as well as for reliably using the reconstructed images as scientific evidence. Unfortunately, existing imaging methods are unable to quantify the uncertainty in the reconstructed images in a manner that is robust to experiment replications. This paper presents a new uncertainty quantification methodology based on an equivariant formulation of the parametric bootstrap algorithm that leverages symmetries and invariance properties commonly encountered in imaging problems. Additionally, the proposed methodology is general and can be easily applied with any image reconstruction technique, including unsupervised training strategies that can be trained from observed data alone, thus enabling uncertainty quantification in situations where there is no ground truth data available. We demonstrate the proposed approach with a series of numerical experiments and through comparisons with alternative uncertainty quantification strategies from the state-of-the-art, such as Bayesian strategies involving score-based diffusion models and Langevin samplers. In all our experiments, the proposed method delivers remarkably accurate high-dimensional confidence regions and outperforms the competing approaches in terms of estimation accuracy, uncertainty quantification accuracy, and computing time.}

Here we explore the extreme case of learning from binary observations and provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the number of measurements required for identifying a set of signals from incomplete binary data. Our results are complementary to existing bounds on signal recovery from binary measurements. Furthermore, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning approach, which we name SSBM, that only requires binary data for training.

However, it is impossible to learn the model using observations obtained via a single incomplete measurement operator, as there is no information outside the range of the inverse operator, resulting in a chicken-and-egg problem: to learn the model we need reconstructed signals, but to reconstruct the signals we need to know the model. Two ways to overcome this limitation are using multiple measurement operators or assuming that the signal model is invariant to a certain group action. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient sensing conditions for learning the signal model from partial measurements which only depend on the dimension of the model, and the number of operators or properties of the group action that the model is invariant to. As our results are agnostic of the learning algorithm, they shed light into the fundamental limitations of learning from incomplete data and have implications in a wide range set of practical algorithms, such as dictionary learning, matrix completion and deep neural networks.},

Reconstructing a scene from observed photons is a challenging task due to spurious detections associated with background illumination sources. To tackle this problem, there is a plethora of 3D reconstruction algorithms which exploit spatial regularity of natural scenes to provide stable reconstructions. However, most existing algorithms have computational and memory complexity proportional to the number of recorded photons. This complexity hinders their real-time deployment on modern lidar arrays which acquire billions of photons per second. Leveraging a recent lidar sketching framework, we show that it is possible to modify existing reconstruction algorithms such that they only require a small sketch of the photon information. In particular, we propose a sketched version of a recent state-of-the-art algorithm which uses point cloud denoisers to provide spatially regularized reconstructions. A series of experiments performed on real lidar datasets demonstrates a significant reduction of execution time and memory requirements, while achieving the same reconstruction performance than in the full data case.},

Indeed, unsupervised learning using a fixed incomplete measurement process is impossible in general, as there is no information in the nullspace of the measurement operator. This limitation can be overcome by using measurements from multiple operators. While this idea has been successfully applied in various applications, a precise characterization of the conditions for learning is still lacking. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the underlying signal model needed for reconstruction which indicate the interplay between the number of distinct measurement operators, the number of measurements per operator, the dimension of the model and the dimension of the signals. Furthermore, we propose a novel and conceptually simple unsupervised learning loss which only requires access to incomplete measurement data and achieves a performance on par with supervised learning when the sufficient condition is verified. We validate our theoretical bounds and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed unsupervised loss compared to previous methods via a series of experiments on various imaging inverse problems, such as accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, compressed sensing and image inpainting. },

Recently, a sketching technique was introduced to overcome this bottleneck which compresses the amount of information to be stored and processed. The size of the sketch scales with the number of underlying parameters of the time delay distribution and not, fundamentally, with either the number of detected photons or the time-stamp resolution. In this paper, we propose a detection algorithm based solely on a small sketch that determines if there are surfaces or objects in the scene or not. If a surface is detected, the depth and intensity of a single object can be computed in closed-form directly from the sketch. The computational load of the proposed detection algorithm depends solely on the size of the sketch, in contrast to previous algorithms that depend at least linearly in the number of collected photons or histogram bins, paving the way for fast, accurate and memory efficient lidar estimation. Our experiments demonstrate the memory and statistical efficiency of the proposed algorithm both on synthetic and real lidar datasets.},

At the core of the technique, the depth of a target is measured by constructing a histogram of time delays between emitted light pulses and detected photon arrivals. A major data processing bottleneck arises on the device when either the number of photons per pixel is large or the resolution of the time-stamp is fine, as both the space requirement and the complexity of the image reconstruction algorithms scale with these parameters. We solve this limiting bottleneck of existing lidar techniques by sampling the characteristic function of the time of flight (ToF) model to build a compressive statistic, a so-called sketch of the time delay distribution, which is sufficient to infer the spatial distance and intensity of the object. The size of the sketch scales with the degrees of freedom of the ToF model (number of objects) and not, fundamentally, with the number of photons or the time-stamp resolution. Moreover, the sketch is highly amenable for on-chip online processing. We show theoretically that the loss of information for compression is controlled and the mean squared error of the inference quickly converges towards the optimal Cramér-Rao bound (i.e. no loss of information) for modest sketch sizes. The proposed compressed single-photon lidar framework is tested and evaluated on real life datasets of complex scenes where it is shown that a compression rate of up-to 150 is achievable in practice without sacrificing the overall resolution of the reconstructed image.},

Modern CNN-based algorithms obtain state-of-the-art performance in diverse image restoration problems. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that, despite being highly overparameterized, networks trained with a single corrupted image can still perform as well as fully trained networks. We introduce a formal link between such networks through their neural tangent kernel (NTK), and well-known non-local filtering techniques, such as non-local means or BM3D. The filtering function associated with a given network architecture can be obtained in closed form without need to train the network, being fully characterized by the random initialization of the network weights. While the NTK theory accurately predicts the filter associated with networks trained using standard gradient descent, our analysis shows that it falls short to explain the behaviour of networks trained using the popular Adam optimizer. The latter achieves a larger change of weights in hidden layers, adapting the non-local filtering function during training. We evaluate our findings via extensive image denoising experiments.},

  abstract = {The safety and success of autonomous vehicles (AVs) depend on their ability to accurately map and respond to their surroundings in real time. One of the most promising recent technologies for depth mapping is single-photon lidar (SPL), which measures the time of flight of individual photons. The long-range capabilities (kilometers), excellent depth resolution (centimeters), and use of low-power (eye-safe) laser sources renders this modality a strong candidate for use in AVs. While presenting unique opportunities, the remarkable sensitivity of single-photon detectors introduces several signal processing challenges. The discrete nature of photon counting and the particular design of the detection devices means the acquired signals cannot be treated as arising in a linear system with additive Gaussian noise. Moreover, the number of useful photon detections may be small despite a large data volume, thus requiring careful modeling and algorithmic design for real-time performance. This article discusses the main working principles of SPL and summarizes recent advances in signal processing techniques for this modality, highlighting promising applications in AVs as well as a number of challenges for vehicular lidar that cannot be solved by better hardware alone.},

	abstract = {Light detection and ranging (Lidar) single-photon devices capture range and intensity information from a three-dimensional (3-D) scene. This modality enables long range 3-D reconstruction with high range precision and low laser power. A multispectral single-photon Lidar system provides additional spectral diversity, allowing the discrimination of different materials. However, the main drawback of such systems can be the long acquisition time needed to collect enough photons in each spectral band. In this work, we tackle this problem in two ways: first, we propose a Bayesian 3-D reconstruction algorithm that is able to find multiple surfaces per pixel, using few photons, i.e., shorter acquisitions. In contrast to previous algorithms, the novel method processes jointly all the spectral bands, obtaining better reconstructions using less photon detections. The proposed model promotes spatial correlation between neighbouring points within a given surface using spatial point processes. Secondly, we account for different spatial and spectral subsampling schemes, which reduce the total number of measurements, without significant degradation of the reconstruction performance. In this way, the total acquisition time, memory requirements and computational time can be significantly reduced. The experiments performed using both synthetic and real single-photon Lidar data demonstrate the advantages of tailored sampling schemes over random alternatives. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm yields better estimates than other existing methods for multi-surface reconstruction using multispectral Lidar data.},

	abstract = {Light detection and ranging (Lidar) data can be used to capture the depth and intensity profile of a 3D scene. This modality relies on constructing, for each pixel, a histogram of time delays between emitted light pulses and detected photon arrivals. In a general setting, more than one surface can be observed in a single pixel. The problem of estimating the number of surfaces, their reflectivity and position becomes very challenging in the low-photon regime (which equates to short acquisition times) or relatively high background levels (i.e., strong ambient illumination). This paper presents a new approach to 3D reconstruction using single-photon, single-wavelength Lidar data, which is capable of identifying multiple surfaces in each pixel. Adopting a Bayesian approach, the 3D structure to be recovered is modelled as a marked point process and reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) moves are proposed to sample the posterior distribution of interest. In order to promote spatial correlation between points belonging to the same surface, we propose a prior that combines an area interaction process and a Strauss process. New RJ-MCMC dilation and erosion updates are presented to achieve an efficient exploration of the configuration space. To further reduce the computational load, we adopt a multiresolution approach, processing the data from a coarse to the finest scale. The experiments performed with synthetic and real data show that the algorithm obtains better reconstructions than other recently published optimization algorithms for lower execution times.},

	abstract = {Single-photon lidar has emerged as a prime candidate technology for depth imaging through challenging environments. Until now, a major limitation has been the significant amount of time required for the analysis of the recorded data. Here we show a new computational framework for real-time three-dimensional (3D) scene reconstruction from single-photon data. By combining statistical models with highly scalable computational tools from the computer graphics community, we demonstrate 3D reconstruction of complex outdoor scenes with processing times of the order of 20 ms, where the lidar data was acquired in broad daylight from distances up to 320 metres. The proposed method can handle an unknown number of surfaces in each pixel, allowing for target detection and imaging through cluttered scenes. This enables robust, real-time target reconstruction of complex moving scenes, paving the way for single-photon lidar at video rates for practical 3D imaging applications.},

The restoration problem is formulated in a Bayesian framework and several state-of-the-art Monte Carlo samplers are considered to estimate the unknown image and quantify its uncertainty. The different samplers are compared through a series of experiments conducted with synthetic images. The results demonstrate the scaling properties of the proposed samplers as the dimensionality of the problem increases and the number of photons decreases. Moreover, our experiments show that for a certain photon budget (i.e., acquisition time of the imaging device), downsampling the observations can yield better reconstruction results.},
