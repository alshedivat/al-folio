	abstract = {While the origin of shadow banks may be traced to the 1970s, developing countries have witnessed a massive growth of shadow banks in more recent decades. India too has seen a similar growth in shadow banks; however, the recent 2018 collapse of IL\&FS Group, a major shadow bank, disrupted the credit cycle, stalled investment and even affected overall GDP growth. With experts warning that shadow banks are susceptible to systemic risks and crisis, it becomes imperative to understand the shadow banking system better. In this paper, we use exploratory data analysis,both quantitative and qualitative, to draw attention to the need for definitional clarity in the concept of shadow banks and how they operate. Trends in Indian shadow banking are discussed using data drawn from secondary sources. Systemic risks in India's shadow banking sector are identified and policy interventions are discussed. The study is imperative for highlighting the importance of shadow banking in India, its growth and the evolving policy interventions regulating this important component of the financial system.},

	abstract = {Using an accounting framework, I examine the evolution of national and sub-national public debt in India from 1981 to 2017, with reference to the FRBM Review Committee Report, which stipulates the debt targets at 60\% and 20\%, respectively. I find that a larger share of debt movement is explained by changes in interest rate, growth and inflation, than by accumulation of new debt, for both national and sub-national debt. Simulations show that a strict perusal of the debt targets will force the government to run surpluses, while relaxing the targets generates fiscal space up to 4\% of the GDP.},

	abstract = {We undertake a narrow and wide replication of 'Are US Cities Underpoliced? Theory and Evidence' by Chalfin and McCrary. Using data from medium to large cities in the United States from 1960 to 2010, the authors estimate the effect of police on crime. To correct for the presence of measurement error, they propose to combine the information from two proxies of the police variable within the generalized method of moments framework. Throughout our replication exercise, we find that, in general, the original results are robust to computation in R compared to STATA and to the inclusion of more recent data (until 2019).},
