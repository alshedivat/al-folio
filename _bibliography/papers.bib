 abstract={How can we tell whether two neural networks utilize the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of dynamics, and two networks performing the same computation with equivalent dynamics need not exhibit the same geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics, called Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA). Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare different systems passed through this embedding using a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. In four case studies, we demonstrate that our method disentangles conjugate and non-conjugate recurrent neural networks (RNNs), while geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method opens the door to comparative analyses of the essential temporal structure of computation in neural circuits.},

              anesthesia. One hypothesis is that anesthesia disrupts dynamic
              stability, the ability of the brain to balance excitability with
              the need to be stable and thus controllable. We tested this
              hypothesis using a new method for quantifying population-level
              dynamic stability in complex systems, Delayed Linear Analysis
              for Stability Estimation (DeLASE). Propofol was used to
              transition animals between the awake state and anesthetized
              unconsciousness. DeLASE was applied to macaque cortex local field
              potentials (LFPs). We found that neural dynamics were more
              unstable in unconsciousness compared to the awake state. Cortical
              trajectories mirrored predictions from destabilized linear
              systems. We mimicked the effect of propofol in simulated neural
              networks by increasing inhibitory tone. Paradoxically, increased
              inhibition also destabilized the networks. Our results suggest
              that anesthesia disrupts dynamical stability that is required for
              consciousness. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors

  abstract      = "To generate coherent responses, language models infer
                   unobserved meaning from their input text sequence. One
                   potential explanation for this capability arises from
                   theories of delay embeddings in dynamical systems, which
                   prove that unobserved variables can be recovered from the
                   history of only a handful of observed variables. To test
                   whether language models are effectively constructing delay
                   embeddings, we measure the capacities of sequence models to
                   reconstruct unobserved dynamics. We trained 1-layer
                   transformer decoders and state-space sequence models on
                   next-step prediction from noisy, partially-observed time
                   series data. We found that each sequence layer can learn a
                   viable embedding of the underlying system. However,
                   state-space models have a stronger inductive bias than
                   transformers-in particular, they more effectively
                   reconstruct unobserved information at initialization,
                   leading to more parameter-efficient models and lower error
                   on dynamics tasks. Our work thus forges a novel connection
                   between dynamical systems and deep learning sequence models
                   via delay embedding theory.",

  title    = "A Lattice Model of Charge-Pattern-Dependent Polyampholyte Phase
              Separation",
  author   = "Das, Suman and Eisen, Adam J. and Lin, Yi-Hsuan and Chan, Hue Sun",
  abstract = "In view of recent intense experimental and theoretical interests
              in the biophysics of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of
              intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), heteropolymer models
              with chain molecules configured as self-avoiding walks on the
              simple cubic lattice are constructed to study how phase behaviors
              depend on the sequence of monomers along the chains. To address
              pertinent general principles, we focus primarily on two fully
              charged 50-monomer sequences with significantly different charge
              patterns. Each monomer in our models occupies a single lattice
              site, and all monomers interact via a screened pairwise Coulomb
              potential. Phase diagrams are obtained by extensive Monte Carlo
              sampling performed at multiple temperatures on ensembles of 300
              chains in boxes of sizes ranging from 52 $\times$ 52 $\times$ 52
              to 246 $\times$ 246 $\times$ 246 to simulate a large number of
              different systems with the overall polymer volume fraction ϕ in
              each system varying from 0.001 to 0.1. Phase separation in the
              model systems is characterized by the emergence of a large
              cluster connected by intermonomer nearest-neighbor lattice
              contacts and by large fluctuations in local polymer density. The
              simulated critical temperatures, Tcr, of phase separation for the
              two sequences differ significantly, whereby the sequence with a
              more ``blocky'' charge pattern exhibits a substantially higher
              propensity to phase separate. The trend is consistent with our
              sequence-specific random-phase-approximation (RPA) polymer
              theory, but the variation of the simulated Tcr with a previously
              proposed ``sequence charge decoration'' pattern parameter is
              milder than that predicted by RPA. Ramifications of our findings
              for the development of analytical theory and simulation protocols
              of IDP LLPS are discussed.",
