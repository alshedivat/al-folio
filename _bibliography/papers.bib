   ABSTRACT   = {This article presents analytical tools for high-level design of the leapfrog (LF) control-bounded analog-to-digital converter (CBADC). We derive closed-form design equations for parameterizing the analog system for a target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bandwidth. Furthermore, we show how the parameterization can be modified to compensate for finite amplifier gain-bandwidth product (GBWP) and to control the signal swing at different nodes of the system. Behavioral circuit simulations are used to compare the LF CBADC to relevant continuous-time sigma–delta modulators (CT- $\Sigma\Delta$ Ms) in terms of nominal performance and sensitivity to component variations, clock jitter, and finite GBWP. Simulations show that the nominal performance of the LF is similar to that of a CT- $\Sigma\Delta$ M of the same loop-filter order and with the same number of quantization levels. The simple, modular structure, analytical stability guarantee, and single-bit quantizers make the LF an interesting alternative to conventional CT- $\Sigma\Delta$ Ms.},

It is demonstrated that variations of the analog frontend can be addressed by calibrating the digital estimation filter. In simulations (both behavioral and transistor level) of a leapfrog analog frontend, the proposed calibration method restores essentially the nominal performance. Moreover, with digital-filter calibration in mind, the paper reformulates the design problem of control-bounded converters and thereby clarifies the role of sampling, desired filter shape, and nominal conversion error.},

   ABSTRACT   = {In this paper, the design flexibility of the control-bounded analog-to-digital converter principle is demonstrated by considering band-pass analog-to-digital conversion. We show how a low-pass control-bounded analog-to-digital converter can be translated into a band-pass version where the guaranteed stability, converter bandwidth, and signal-to-noise ratio are preserved while the center frequency for conversion can be positioned freely. The proposed converter is validated with behavioral simulations for a variety of filter orders, notch-filter frequencies, and oversampling ratios. Finally, robustness against component variations is demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations.},

   ABSTRACT   = {A control-bounded analog-to-digital converter consists of a linear analog system that is subject to digital control, and a digital filter that estimates the analog input signal from the digital control signals. Such converters have many commonalities with delta--sigma converters, but they can use more general analog filters. The paper describes the operating principle, gives a transfer function analysis, and describes the digital filtering. In addition, the paper discusses two examples of such architectures. The first example is a cascade structure reminiscent of, but simpler than, a high-order MASH converter. The second example combines two attractive properties that have so far been considered incompatible. Its nominal conversion noise (assuming ideal components) essentially equals that of the first example. However, its analog filter is a fully connected network to which the input signal is fed in parallel, which potentially makes it more robust against nonidealities.},

The method can also be used for digital-to-analog conversion.The heart of the proposed method is a new binary-enforcing NUV prior (normal with unknown variance). The resulting computations, for each planning period, amount to iterating forward-backward Gaussian message passing recursions (similar to Kalman smoothing), with a complexity (per iteration) that is linear in the planning horizon. In consequence, the proposed method is not limited to a short planning horizon.},

   ABSTRACT   = {The need for analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) conver- sion is a ubiquitous part of many of today’s practical applications. The research fields of A/D and D/A conversion are multi-disciplinary, involv- ing topics such as discrete- and continuous-time signal processing, circuit theory, and circuit design. State-of-the-art achievements have refined the practical aspects of traditional converter architectures to a point where performance is reaching its physical limits and progress is stagnating.
              In this thesis, we present an alternative perspective of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion called control-bounded conversion. This new perspective utilizes standard circuit components to build up un- conventional circuit architectures through a novel theoretical framework between analog and digital. Ultimately, this versatile design principle allows less constrained analog and digital circuit architectures at the expense of a digital post-processing step.
              We demonstrate the control-bounded conversion principle by a selection of converter examples. First we consider the chain-of-integrators and the leapfrog analog-to-digital converters, which emphasize the division of the analog and digital parts of a control-bounded analog-to-digital converter. In particular, these examples reveal the global nature of the analog design task compared to the local digital part, which can be decomposed into independently operated, sub-circuits.
              Next, the chain-of-oscillators analog-to-digital converter shows how the control-bounded converter can be adapted for the problem of converting non-baseband signals as is common in communication systems. Specifi- cally, the modulation task (frequency shifting) is incorporated into the digital part of the circuit, removing the need for a pre-processing step. To suppress the influence of circuit imperfections, we introduce the Hadamard analog-to-digital converter that separates the physical and the logical signal dimensions of a control-bounded converter. This separation enables circuit architectures where the sensitivity to component mismatch and thermal noise can be distributed equally throughout the circuit architecture components, thereby minimizing its impact on conversion performance.
              The overcomplete digital control shows how the digital part’s complexity can be increased, resulting in better conversion performance, without substantially increasing the sensitivity to circuit imperfections. This idea relates to using higher-order quantization but partitions the analog part of the circuit in a novel way.
              We demonstrate that the control-bounded analog-to-digital conversion concept can provide improved conversion performance when converting multiple signals jointly as opposed to independent conversion.
              Finally, we show how the control-bounded conversion principle can be adopted for digital-to-analog conversion.

   ABSTRACT   = {Normal priors with unknown variance (NUV) are well known to include a large class of sparsity promoting priors and to blend well with Gaussian message passing. Essentially equivalently, sparsifying norms (including the L1 norm) as well as the Huber cost function from robust statistics have variational representations that lead to algorithms based on iteratively reweighted L2-regularization. In this paper, we rephrase these well-known facts in terms of factor graphs. In particular, we propose a smoothed-NUV representation of the Huber function and of a related nonconvex cost function, and we illustrate their use for sparse least-squares with outliers and in a natural (piecewise smooth) prior for imaging. We also point out pertinent iterative algorithms including variations of gradient descent and coordinate descent.},

   ABSTRACT   = {The rapid progress of invasive therapeutic options for cardiac arrhythmias increases the need for accurate diagnostics. The surface electrocardiogram (ECG) is still the standard of noninvasive diagnostics but lacks atrial signal resolution. By contrast, esophageal electrocardiography (EECG) yields atrial signals of high amplitude and with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Esophageal electrocardiography has become fast and safe, but the mechanical constraints of esophageal measuring catheters and the “random” motion of the catheter inside the subject's esophagus limit the spatial resolution of EECG signals. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the electrical field projected onto the esophagus with an increased spatial resolution, using commonly available esophageal catheters. In a first step, we estimate the time-varying catheter position, and in a second step, we estimate the projected electrical field with enhanced spatial resolution. The proposed algorithm comprises several consecutive optimization steps, where each intermediate step produces not just a single point estimate, but a cost function over multiple solutions, which reduces the information loss at each processing step. We conclude with examples from a clinical trial, where the fields of cardiac arrhythmias are presented as two-dimensional contour plots.},

All signals are represented by a linear state space model (LSSM). The baseline model is driven by white Gaussian noise, but the other signal models are triggered by sparse inputs. Sparsity is achieved by normal priors with unknown variance (NUV) from sparse Bayesian learning. All signals and system parameters are jointly estimated with an efficient expectation maximization (EM) algorithm based on Gaussian message passing, which works both for known and unknown signal shapes. The proposed method outputs a sparse multi-channel representation of the given signal, which can be interpreted as a signal labeling.},

Unlike related prior work, the proposed algorithm does not alternate between estimating the input signal and estimating the system parameters; instead, all unknown quantities are jointly updated in each EM step. We give closed-form expressions for these EM updates, which can be efficiently computed by Gaussian message passing.},
