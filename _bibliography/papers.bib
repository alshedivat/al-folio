  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={Flat objects lying on a surface are hard to grasp, but could be manipulated by sliding along the surface in a non-prehensile
manner. This strategy is commonly employed by humans as pre-manipulation, for example to bring a cell phone to the edge
of a table to pick it up. To endow robots with a similar capability, we introduce a mathematical model of planar sliding by
means of a soft finger. The model reveals various aspects of interaction through frictional contacts, which can be used for
planning and control. Specifically, using a quasi-static analysis we are able to derive a hybrid dynamical system to predict
the motion of the object and the interaction forces. The conditions for which the object sticks to the friction patch, pivots,
or completely slides against it are obtained. It is possible to find fixed points of the system and the path taken by the object
to reach such configurations. Theoretical as well as comprehensive experimental results are presented.

  abstract={Automating the act of grasping is one of the most compelling challenges in robotics. In recent times, a major trend has
gained the attention of the robotic grasping community: soft manipulation. Along with the design of intrinsically soft
robotic hands, it is important to devise grasp planning strategies that can take into account the hand characteristics, but
are general enough to be applied to different robotic systems. In this article, we investigate how to perform top grasps
with soft hands according to a model-based approach, using both power and precision grasps. The so-called closure signature (CS) is used to model closure motions of soft hands by associating to them a preferred grasping direction. This
direction can be aligned to a suitable direction over the object to achieve successful top grasps. The CS-alignment is here
combined with a recently developed AI-driven grasp planner for rigid grippers that is adjusted and used to retrieve an
estimate of the optimal grasp to be performed on the object. The resulting grasp planner is tested with multiple experimental trials with two different robotic hands. A wide set of objects with different shapes was grasped successfully},

  abstract={Aspects described herein provide structures for a force sensor, and force sensors using such structures, which are compact and easy to manufacture, for example by 3D printing. In particular the structures comprise a pair of stacked ring sensor elements, the ring sensor elements in turn being formed by upper and lower ring elements joined together at points around the circumference thereof by resiliently mounted connection bars. The connection bars may extend in the same plane as the rings, in which case sensitivity to torque about the axis of the rings is much reduced, such that a five-axis sensor is effectively obtained, or the connection bars may extend obliquely between the upper and lower rings of each sensor element, such that they have a directional component in the direction of the axis of the rings (the rings of each element being co-axially stacked). In this second case application of a torque about the ring axis causes the oblique connection bars to either increase or decrease their directional component in the axial direction, thus providing sensitivity to torque about the axis, and providing a compact six axis sensor.},

abstract={One of the key advantages of robots is the high speeds at which they can operate. In industrial settings, increased velocities can lead to higher throughputs and improved efficiency. Some manipulation tasks might require the robot to perform highly dynamic operations such as shaking, or swinging while grasping an object. These fast movements may produce high accelerations and thus give rise to inertial forces that can cause a grasped object to slip. In this paper a method is proposed to determine the inertial forces that arise on a grasped object during a trajectory, find the instances at which the object might slip, and avoid these slippages by changing the trajectory, namely the orientation of the object. To exemplify the usage of this approach, two grasping tasks are realised: a prehensile and a non-prehensile grasp, and strategies to successfully perform these tasks without changing the overall duration of the trajectory are defined and evaluated.},

  abstract={Intuitive interaction is the cornerstone of accurate and effective performance in remote robotic teleoperation. It requires high-fidelity in control actions as well as perception (vision, haptic, and other sensory feedback) of the remote environment. This paper presents Vicarios, a Virtual Reality (VR) based interface with the aim of facilitating intuitive real-time remote teleoperation, while utilizing the inherent benefits of VR, including immersive visualization, freedom of user viewpoint selection, and fluidity of interaction through natural action interfaces. Vicarios aims to enhance the situational awareness, using the concept of viewpoint-independent mapping between the operator and the remote scene, thereby giving the operator better control in the perception-action loop. The article describes the overall system of Vicarios, with its software, hardware, and communication framework. A comparative user study quantifies the impact of the interface and its features, including immersion and instantaneous user viewpoint changes, termed “teleporting”, on users’ performance. The results show that users’ performance with the VR-based interface was either similar to or better than the baseline condition of traditional stereo video feedback, approving the realistic nature of the Vicarios interface. Furthermore, including the teleporting feature in VR significantly improved participants’ performance and their appreciation for it, which was evident in the post-questionnaire results. Vicarios capitalizes on the intuitiveness and flexibility of VR to improve accuracy in remote teleoperation.},

  abstract={Despite great innovations in upper-extremity prosthetic hardware in recent decades, controlling a multiple joint upper limb prosthesis such as an elbow/wrist/hand system is still an open clinical challenge, in large part due to an insufficient number of control inputs available to users. While simultaneous control is in its early stages, the common control approach is sequential control, in which joints and grasps are driven one at a time. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a concept we call trajectory control, that builds upon this approach, in which motions of the wrist, elbow, and shoulder DOFs (and subsets of them) are coupled into predefined sets of coordinated trajectories; to be selected by the user and driven with a single input variable. These trajectories were designed based on an earlier motion study of activities of daily life obtained from human demonstrations. We experimentally evaluate the efficacy of our approach through a human subjects study in which tasks are performed in a virtual environment. The results show that as device complexity increased (i.e. greater number of DOFs corresponding to more proximal amputations), participants were able to complete tasks faster with trajectory control while exhibiting similar levels of body compensation when compared to sequential and simultaneous control. Additionally, participants found trajectory control to be more intuitive and displayed more natural movement.},

   abstract={This letter presents an algorithm to simultaneously reconstruct the geometry of an unknown object and its environment via physical interactions. Applications involving highly cluttered or occluded workspaces prevent the effective use of vision. To address some of the challenges that arise, we propose an approach that instead utilizes force and torque measurements at the robot end-effector to solve for possible contact locations and probabilistically determine the occupancy likelihood on a 3D map. Our procedure constructs two occupancy maps: one fixed that represents the environment and another map that moves with the robot end-effector and reconstructs the grasped object shape, where each map informs the probability updates on the other. The algorithm is applied and tested on two scenarios: retrieving a tangled object from a scene and reconstructing the geometry of an object. We compare the results against a configuration space planner and a reinforcement learning algorithm, with our method requiring fewer collisions with the environment to extract the object.},
