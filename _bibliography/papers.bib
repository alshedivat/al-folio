  abstract={A new approach to L2-consistent estimation of a general density functional using k-nearest neighbor distances is proposed, where the functional under consideration is in the form of the expectation of some function f of the densities at each point. The estimator is designed to be asymptotically unbiased, using the convergence of the normalized volume of a k-nearest neighbor ball to a Gamma distribution in the large-sample limit, and naturally involves the inverse Laplace transform of a scaled version of the function f. Some instantiations of the proposed estimator recover existing k-nearest neighbor based estimators of Shannon and Rényi entropies and Kullback–Leibler and Rényi divergences, and discover new consistent estimators for many other functionals such as logarithmic entropies and divergences. The L2-consistency of the proposed estimator is established for a broad class of densities for general functionals, and the convergence rate in mean squared error is established as a function of the sample size for smooth, bounded densities.},

In contrast to existing kernel-based spectral methods such as kernel principal component analysis and Laplacian eigenmaps, the new embedding algorithm only involves estimating density at each query point without any eigendecomposition of a matrix.
A concrete example of dot-product kernels over hypersphere is provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework.},

  abstract={A class of parameter-free online linear optimization algorithms is proposed that harnesses the structure of an adversarial sequence by adapting to some side information. These algorithms combine the reduction technique of Orabona and P{\'a}l (2016) for adapting coin betting algorithms for online linear optimization with universal compression techniques in information theory for incorporating sequential side information to coin betting.
Concrete examples are studied in which the side information has a tree structure and consists of quantized values of the previous symbols of the adversarial sequence, including fixed-order and variable-order Markov cases.
By modifying the context-tree weighting technique of Willems, Shtarkov, and Tjalkens (1995), the proposed algorithm is further refined to achieve the best performance over all adaptive algorithms with tree-structured side information of a given maximum order in a computationally efficient manner.},

  abstract={A new portfolio selection strategy that adapts to a continuous side-information sequence is presented, with a universal wealth guarantee against a class of state-constant rebalanced portfolios with respect to a state function that maps each side-information symbol to a finite set of states.
In particular, given that a state function belongs to a collection of functions of finite Natarajan dimension, the proposed strategy is shown to achieve, asymptotically to first order in the exponent, the same wealth as the best state-constant rebalanced portfolio with respect to the best state function, chosen in hindsight from observed market.
This result can be viewed as an extension of the seminal work of Cover and Ordentlich (1996) that assumes a single state function.},

  abstract={Recently, Qiao, Duan, and Cheng~(2019) proposed a distributed nearest-neighbor classification method, in which a massive dataset is split into smaller groups, each processed with a $k$-nearest-neighbor classifier, and the final class label is predicted by a majority vote among these groupwise class labels.
This paper shows that the distributed algorithm with $k=1$ over a sufficiently large number of groups attains a minimax optimal error rate up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor under some regularity conditions, for both regression and classification problems.
Roughly speaking, distributed 1-nearest-neighbor rules with $M$ groups has a performance comparable to standard $\Theta(M)$-nearest-neighbor rules.
In the analysis, alternative rules with a refined aggregation method are proposed and shown to attain exact minimax optimal rates.},

  abstract={This paper considers the problem of constructing a confidence sequence for bounded random processes.
Building upon the gambling approach pioneered by Hendriks (2018) and Jun and Orabona (2019) and following the recent work of Waudby-Smith and Ramdas (2020) and Orabona and Jun (2021),
this paper revisits the idea of Cover (1991)'s universal portfolio in constructing confidence sequences and demonstrates new properties, based on a natural \emph{two-horse race} perspective on the gambling approach.
The main result of this paper is a new algorithm based on a mixture of lower bounds, which closely approximates the performance of Cover's universal portfolio with only constant per-round time complexity.
A higher-order generalization of a lower bound in (Fan et al, 2015), which is invoked in the proposed algorithm, may be of independent interest.},

  author+an={1=highlight},
  abstract={A new bimodal generative model is proposed for generating conditional and joint samples, accompanied with a training method with learning a succinct bottleneck representation.
The proposed model, dubbed as the variational Wyner model, is designed based on two classical problems in network information theory---distributed simulation and channel synthesis---in which Wyner's common information arises as the fundamental limit on the succinctness of the common representation.
The model is trained by minimizing the symmetric Kullback--Leibler divergence between variational and model distributions with regularization terms for common information, reconstruction consistency, and latent space matching terms, which is carried out via an adversarial density ratio estimation technique.
The utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments for joint and conditional generation with synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as a challenging zero-shot image retrieval task.},
