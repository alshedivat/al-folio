  title={The Last Hurdle? Unyielding Motherhood Effects in the Context of Declining Gender Inequality in Latin America},

  abstract={This paper exploress the link between the effect of children on mothers' earnings—the socalled child penalty—and the observed gender earnings gap in Latin America over the last two decades. Leveraging repeated cross-sectional data from harmonized household surveys spanning the 2000-2021 period in 14 countries, we estimate the impact of motherhood on earnings using a pseudo-event study approach around the birth of the first child (Kleven, 2022). Unlike traditional event studies that rely on panel data, we build pseudo-panels at the individual level by matching individuals with similar observable characteristics, including birth cohort, allowing us to track fathers and mothers over time, and estimate the effect of children on their earnings. These effects are then used as inputs in an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to quantify their contribution to the observed gender earnings gap. Our f indings reveal that the motherhood effect is possibly the single most important factor contributing to the remaining income disparities between men and women in the region: it represents 41% of the gender gap among parents and 34% of the overall gender earnings gap. Importantly, its relative importance has been increasing over the years. Specifically, while the overall earnings gap between fathers and mothers decreased by more than eight percentage points over the last two decades, the motherhood-related gap remained nearly constant. As a result, the share of the motherhood-related gap within the total gender earnings gap increased from 37% to over 46%. Furthermore, a country-by-country analysis reveals that the motherhood-related gap shows little variation across countries and does not correlate with GDP per capita, suggesting the distinct rigidity of gender gaps stemming from the motherhood effect compared to other determinants of gender income inequality. We also provide a comprehensive overview of the motherhood effects on labor market outcomes beyond mere employment status and earnings, such as hours worked and labor informality. This sheds light on key mechanisms underlying labor market adjustments upon motherhood in Latin America.},

  abstract={We assess the extent of discrimination against gay and transgender individuals in the rental housing markets of four Latin American countries. We conducted a large-scale field experiment building on the correspondence study methodology to examine interactions between property managers and fictitious couples engaged in searches on a major online rental housing platform. We find no evidence of discrimination against gay male couples, but we do find strong discrimination against heterosexual couples with a transgender woman partner (trans couples). Relative to heterosexual couples, trans couples receive 19% fewer responses, 27% fewer positive responses, and 23% fewer invitations to showings. We also assess whether the evidence is consistent with taste-based discrimination or statistical discrimination models by comparing response rates when couples signal being professionals with stable jobs (quality-job signal). While we find no significant effect of the signal for heterosexual or gay male couples, trans couples benefit from providing a strong labor market signal. Their call-back, positive-response, and invitation rates increase by 25%, 36% and 29%, respectively. These results suggest that discrimination against trans couples is consistent with statistical discrimination. Moreover, we find no evidence of heterosexual couples being favored over gay male couples, nor evidence of statistical discrimination for gay male or heterosexual couples.},

  author={Pedrazzi, Julian and Pe{\~n}aloza-Pacheco, Leonardo},
  journal={The Journal of Development Studies},
  pages={1--18},
  year={2023},
  publisher={Taylor \& Francis},
  abstract={In this paper, we analyze the impact of Venezuelan migration on the female labor market in Colombia. Following the economic crisis in Venezuela, more than 1.5 million Venezuelans arrived in Colombia in the period 2016–2019. Using an instrumental variables approach, we find that the sudden influx of millions of migrants reduced the labor force participation of less-skilled native women due to a disproportionate increase of competition in economic activities in which they were more concentrated. On the other hand, migration positively affected the labor force participation for high-skilled women with children. When testing the underlying mechanisms of this latter result, we find a reduction in the time spent on childcare and an increase in the probability of hiring domestic service, explained by a decrease in the cost of this service due to the Venezuelan exodus.},
