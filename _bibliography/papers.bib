title={Implementation and Comparison of Substitution Trees and Instance Tries},
author={Lydia Kondylidou},
supervisor={Francois Bry, Thomas Prokosch},
abstract={Term indexing methods have a major impact on the speed of logic programming lan-
  guages and automated theorem proving systems. Substitution trees are well estab-
  lished term indexes for logic programming and theorem proving because of their per-
  formances. However, they rely on heuristics and ignore the partial order that is in-
  herent to terms. On the other hand, instance tries have been recently proposed as a
  novel term index for logic programming and automated theorem proving. Instance
  tries make use of the term order without having to resort to heuristics. In this bache-
  lor’s thesis, the efficiency of instance tries is examined in more detail on the basis of
  established benchmarks and and it is compared with that of substitution trees.},

title={Supporting a CDCL Sat Solver by BDD Methods},
author={Lydia Kondylidou},
abstract={Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is one of the most important problems of theoretical computer
  science with many practical applications in which Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers are
  used in the background as high-performance reasoning engines. These applications include
  automated planning and scheduling, formal verification, and automated theorem proving. In
  the last decades, the performance of state-of-the-art SAT solvers has increased dramatically,
  thanks to the invention of advanced heuristics, preprocessing and inprocessing techniques,
  and data structures that allow efficient implementation of search space pruning. The in-
  creasing popularity of SAT in verification and synthesis encourages the search for additional
  speed-ups. This paper presents a new approach to support a Conflict Driven Clause Learning
  (CDCL) SAT solver with Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) techniques. While SAT and BDD
  techniques are often presented as mutually exclusive alternatives, this work points out that
  both can be improved by running in parallel and exchanging information. In this thesis, a
  BDD library is implemented in Rust, designed to support the latest version of the Glucose
  SAT solver. The proposed methods are based on efficient communication between the two
  architectures. Several benchmarks from the SAT competitions are run both on Glucose alone
  and Glucose with the contribution of the BDDs, and the results are compared. Eventually,
  the experiments show that the performance of Glucose is improved when running in parallel
  with the BDD solver.},
