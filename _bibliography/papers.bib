  abstract={Robotic grasping is a fundamental task for many robots to interact with the outside world, and it is still challenging. There are at least three tasks for robot grasping: object localization, grasp pose estimation, and motion planning. This paper presents a low-cost machine vision solution for robotic grasping based on template matching, including comparisons between different approaches, including state-of-the-art YOLOv4 object detection and edge-based geometric shape detection. The robotic grasping solution presented in this paper shows a high pick-and-place success rate. An improvement for template matching is implemented in this paper as well. This paper also provides detailed analysis, algorithms, and experiments.},

abstract={The MBot mobile robotics project aims to develop an autonomous ground vehicle to navigate in the unknown environment. There are four key components of the project. Low-level control executes commands from high-level system to drive the robot based on velocity models and kinematics with a PID controller. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is at the core of MBot project which allows the robot to use LiDAR to build a map of the environment and localize in that map at the same time. We developed mapping module, particle filter with action model and sensor model. Additionally, we implemented AStar (A*) heuristic search with pruning algorithm for path planning and frontier-guided algorithm for exploration. We present the theory and detailed imple- mentation with experimental results for the project in this report.},
