  abstract={Thermal conductivity of binary aqueous solutions of 1,2-ethanediol and 1,2-propanediol was measured using the transient hot wire method at temperature from 253.15 K to 373.15 K at atmospheric. Measurements were made for six compositions over the entire concentration range from 0 to 1 mole fraction of glycol, namely, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mole fraction of glycol. The uncertainty of the thermal conductivity, temperature, and concentration measurements are estimated to be better than 2%, 0.01K, 0.1%, respectively. The second-order Scheffé polynomial is used to correlate the temperature and composition dependence of the experimental thermal conductivity, which is found to be in good agreement with the experiment data from the present work and other reports.

  abstract={High performance thermal insulation materials are desired for a wide range of applications in space, buildings, energy, and environments. Here, a facile ambient processing approach is reported to synthesize a highly insulating and flexible monolithic poly(vinyl chloride) aerogel. The thermal conductivity is measured respectively as 28 mW (m K)<sup>-1</sup> at atmosphere approaching the air conductivity and 7.7 mW (m K)<sup>-1</sup> under mild evacuation condition. Thermal modeling is performed to understand the thermal conductivity contributions from different heat transport pathways in air and solid. The analysis based on the Knudsen effect and scattering mean free paths shows that the thermal insulation performance can be further improved through the optimization of porous structures to confine the movement of air molecules. Additionally, the prepared aerogels show superhydrophobicity due to the highly porous structures, which enables new opportunities for surface engineering. Together, the study demonstrates an energy‐saving and scalable ambient‐processing pathway to achieve ultralight, flexible, and superhydrophobic poly(vinyl chloride) aerogel for thermal insulation applications.}

  abstract={Stability of objects in fluid flow is an interesting and significant subject in many fields. From thermodynamics point of view, the constructal law by Bejan et al. proposed that in some scenario, objects tend to be stable when the drag reaches maximum. To investigate the relation between drag and stable positions, we analyzed two simple cases by the finite element method: an elliptical cylinder and a rectangular cylinder immersed in 2D uniform laminar flow. The ellipse is stable when its major axis is perpendicular to the mainstream and the drag reaches maximum; yet the rectangle is stable when the length is perpendicular to the mainstream, with drag ranging from minimum to maximum depending on its aspect ratio. Our results show that there is no universal relation between drag and stability.}

  abstract = {We report a method to optimize the topology of porous electrodes without a prior assumption of the pattern. We take a two-dimensional NMC-Li cell as an example. The domain of NMC is discretized by a 5×5 mesh and the solid volume fraction is represented by 25 nodal variables. We use a deep-learning-boosted optimization algorithm to find the optimal material distribution that gives the maximum specific energy. The method produces an electrode pattern with 18% higher specific energy than that of a uniform electrode. This generic geometry optimization approach provides a powerful tool for the design and optimization of porous electrodes.}

  abstract={Topology optimization by optimally distributing materials in a given domain requires stochastic optimizers to solve highly complicated problems. However, with hundreds of design variables or more involved, solving such problems would require millions of Finite Element Method (FEM) calculations whose computational cost is huge and impractical. Here we report a self-directed online learning method which integrates Deep Neural Network (DNN) with FEM calculations. A DNN learns and substitutes the objective as a function of design variables. A small amount of training data are generated dynamically around the DNN's prediction of the global optimum. The DNN adapts to the new training data and gives better prediction in the region of interest until convergence. Our algorithm was tested by compliance minimization problems and demonstrated a reduction of computational time by over two orders of magnitude than the current method. This approach enables solving very large multi-dimensional optimization problems.

  abstract={Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) are two popular methods to measure the diffusivity of lithium ions in electrode particles. What has puzzled the community for a long time is that these two techniques often give an order of magnitude difference in the results. By analyzing the diffusion profile and approximation error for various particle geometries, we show that these two techniques are consistent only when the current excitation does not impact deep inside the particles, which corresponds to the condition of short pulse time for GITT or high frequency for EIS. GITT does not depend on particle size by its assumption while EIS does. Thus we propose an innovative approach of using EIS to determine diffusivity accurately independent of particle size or geometry. We further demonstrate experimentally that the two techniques yield identical results under the right measurement conditions. This work may provide insight on the scattering of measured diffusivity data in the literature.}

  abstract={Sodium ion batteries become popular due to their low cost. Among possible anode materials of sodium ion batteries, phosphorus has great potential owing to its high theoretical capacity. Previous research that yielded high capacity of phosphorus anode used very expensive materials such as black phosphorus (BP) and phosphorene. To take advantage of the low cost of sodium ion batteries, we proposed a new method to make anode: condensing red phosphorus (RP) on carbon xerogel. Even with large particle size (~ 50 μm) and high mass loading (2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>), the composite cycled at 200 mA/g yielded a capacity of 242 mA/g, or 1993 mAh/g based on phosphorus after subtracting the contribution of carbon. The average degradation rate is only 0.06% in 80 cycles. The average columbic efficiency is as high as 99.2%. Our research provided an innovative approach to synthesis of anodes for sodium ion batteries, which could promote their commercialization.}

  abstract={Machine learning has been heavily researched and widely used in many disciplines. However, achieving high accuracy requires a large amount of data that is sometimes difficult, expensive, or impractical to obtain. Integrating human knowledge into machine learning can significantly reduce data requirement, increase reliability and robustness of machine learning, and build explainable machine learning systems. This allows leveraging the vast amount of human knowledge and capability of machine learning to achieve functions and performance not available before and will facilitate the interaction between human beings and machine learning systems, making machine learning decisions understandable to humans. This paper gives an overview of the knowledge and its representations that can be integrated into machine learning and the methodology. We cover the fundamentals, current status, and recent progress of the methods, with a focus on popular and new topics. The perspectives on future directions are also discussed.}
