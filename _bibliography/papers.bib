  abstract = {We investigated the origins and interrelations of causal knowledge and 
              knowledge of agency in 3-month-old infants, who cannot yet effect changes in 
              the world by reaching for, grasping, and picking up objects. Across 5 experiments, 
              n = 152 prereaching infants viewed object-directed reaches that varied in efficiency 
              (following the shortest physically possible path vs. a longer path), goal 
              (lifting an object vs. causing a change in its state), and causal structure 
              (action on contact vs. action at a distance and after a delay). Prereaching infants 
              showed no strong looking preference between a person's efficient and inefficient 
              reaches when the person grasped and displaced an object. When the person reached for 
              and caused a change in the state of the object on contact, however, infants looked 
              longer when this action was inefficient than when it was efficient. Three-month-old 
              infants also showed a key signature of adults' and older infants' causal inferences: 
              This looking preference was abolished if a short spatial and temporal gap separated 
              the action from its effect. The basic intuition that people are causal agents, who 
              navigate around physical constraints to change the state of the world, may be one 
              important foundation for infants' ability to plan their own actions and learn from 
              the acts of others.},

              of developmental research for researchers and participants alike.
              While its popularity among developmental scientists has soared
              during the COVID-19 pandemic, its potential goes beyond just a
              means for safe, socially distanced data collection. In
              particular, advances in video conferencing software has enabled
              researchers to engage in face-to-face interactions with
              participants from nearly any location at any time. Due to the
              novelty of these methods, however, many researchers still remain
              uncertain about the differences in available approaches as well
              as the validity of online methods more broadly. In this article,
              we aim to address both issues with a focus on moderated
              (synchronous) data collected using video-conferencing software
              (e.g., Zoom). First, we review existing approaches for designing
              and executing moderated online studies with young children. We
              also present concrete examples of studies that implemented choice
              and verbal measures (Studies 1 and 2) and looking time (Studies 3
              and 4) across both in-person and online moderated data collection
              methods. Direct comparison of the two methods within each study
              as well as a meta-analysis of all studies suggest that the
              results from the two methods are comparable, providing empirical
              support for the validity of moderated online data collection.
              Finally, we discuss current limitations of online data collection
              and possible solutions, as well as its potential to increase the

              coincidentally or did they arise because they are rooted in a
              common neural computation? To address this question, we used
              statistical pattern recognition techniques to analyze human fMRI
              data. First, a machine learning algorithm was trained to
              discriminate patterns of fMRI responses based on relative
              egocentric distance within trials from one distance domain (e.g.,
              photographs of objects relatively close to or far away from the
              viewer in spatial distance trials). Next, we tested whether the
              decision boundary generated from this training could distinguish
              brain responses according to relative egocentric distance within
              each of two separate distance domains (e.g., phrases referring to
              the immediate or more remote future within temporal distance
              trials; photographs of participants' friends or acquaintances
              within social distance trials). This procedure was repeated using
              all possible combinations of distance domains for training and
              testing the classifier. In all cases, above-chance decoding
              across distance domains was possible in the right inferior
              parietal lobule (IPL). Furthermore, the representational
              similarity structure within this brain area reflected
              participants' own judgments of spatial distance, temporal
              soon-ness, and social familiarity. Thus, the right IPL may

  abstract = "Abstract Human prosocial behaviors are supported by
              early-emerging psychological processes that detect and fulfill
              the needs of others. However, little is known about the
              mechanisms that enable children to deliver benefits to others at
              costs to the self, which requires weighing other-regarding and
              self-serving preferences. We used an intertemporal choice
              paradigm to systematically study and compare these behaviors in
              5-year-old children. Our results show that other-benefiting and
              self-benefiting behavior share a common decision-making process
              that integrates delay and reward. Specifically, we found that
              children sought to minimize delay and maximize reward, and traded
              off delays against rewards, regardless of whether these rewards
              were for the children themselves or another child. However, we
              found that children were more willing to invest their time to
              benefit themselves than someone else. Together, these findings
              show that from childhood, other- and self-serving decisions are
              supported by a general mechanism that flexibly integrates
              information about the magnitude of rewards, and the opportunity
              costs of pursuing them. A video abstract of this article can be

              promising system for automatic gaze annotation in human infants,
              iCatcher (Erel et al., 2020), and added two key additional
              features: a more robust infant face detector, and a gaze
              estimator that takes into account not only the features of the
              selected face, but where and how far it is from the screen. In

              selected by a infant selector; finally, the gaze direction is
              classified by a gaze estimator based on both the selected face

              that the possibility of failure endows risky actions with

              Three experiments addressed this question by presenting 10- and
              13-month-old infants (N=124) with an agent who chose whether or
              not to jump over a trench of varying depth to reach two goals. At

              the agent fail to complete its action successfully. Moreover,
              they learned which goal the agent preferred by observing how much
              peril it risked to reach each goal. Although findings at 10
              months were not clear, these findings provide evidence that
              13-month-old infants represent danger as a kind of cost, possibly

                   the ability to reason about hidden mental variables that
                   drive observable actions, comes naturally to people: even
                   pre-verbal infants can tell agents from objects, expecting

                   psychology. We validate AGENT with human-ratings, propose an
                   evaluation protocol emphasizing generalization, and compare
                   two strong baselines built on Bayesian inverse planning and
                   a Theory of Mind neural network. Our results suggest that to
                   pass the designed tests of core intuitive psychology at
                   human levels, a model must acquire or have built-in
                   representations of how agents plan, combining utility
                   computations and core knowledge of objects and physics.",
