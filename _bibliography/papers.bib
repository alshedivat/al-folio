recovery monitoring in burned environments of British Columbia, Canada},
	organization = {2022 Forest Disturbance Symposium},
	abstract = {Satellite-based methods to identify and map forest disturbances over broad spatial scales are
well documented in the scientific literature and have improved in both spatial and temporal
resolution with openly available time series data and computational capacity. Forest managers
and silvicultural planners also require methods for post-disturbance monitoring of successful
tree regeneration and ecosystem recovery. Broad-scale forest recovery monitoring is
particularly important in western North America, which increasingly experiences large natural
disturbance events, including wildfires, which pose a challenge for reforestation efforts
Methods to monitor post-disturbance forest recovery using satellite imagery (including possible
shifts in forest composition or type) are emerging and require verification and validation with
complimentary indicators of successful regeneration, specifically measures of forest structure.
Here, we focus on interior British Columbia, a timber dependent economic region that has
experienced significant large wildfires over the last decade alongside historic mountain pine
beetle outbreaks. We measured forest structure (e.g., tree density, height, etc.) using lidar data
acquired from both aircraft and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) in areas impacted by wildfires
in 2010 and 2017. We then applied a space-for-time approach to relate spectral observations
from Landsat time series data acquired five years post-fire to lidar and field measured forest
structure. Our results indicate that the density of regenerating trees is accurately measured
with lidar and that these measures of density relate to differences in spectral metrics observed
at five-years post-fire. The overall goal of this research is to develop tools that aid landscapelevel silvicultural planning},

	abstract = {Repeated moderate severity forest disturbances can cause short- and long-term shifts in ecosystem processes. Prior work has found that stand-replacing disturbances (e.g., clear-cutting) increase streamflow in temperate forests, but streamflow responses to repeated moderate severity disturbances are more equivocal. This study examined a moderate disturbance caused by an unexpected population irruption of the invasive insect Lymantria dispar (common name: gypsy moth) in 2015–2017. This irruption resulted in defoliation that was locally severe in some areas but spatially heterogeneous at a regional scale. L. dispar larvae consume leaves during the summer growing season, which effectively reduces tree leaf area and associated evapotranspiration. Our regional approach in Southern New England, USA, used data from 83 US Geological Survey (USGS) stream gages to assess whether changes in growing-season watershed runoff ratios and instantaneous streamflow characteristics during the 2015–2017 L. dispar irruption were associated with satellite-derived metrics of changes in forest condition (i.e., defoliation), compared to a 20-year baseline streamflow period. We found a small, linear increase in growing-season runoff ratio anomalies that was associated with defoliation intensity. The association between defoliation intensity and runoff ratio anomalies was magnified in less anthropogenically impacted reference watersheds. We also found that defoliation intensity was associated with larger volumes of high and medium instantaneous streamflows compared to baseline mean flow conditions. This study provided important insights into the impacts of moderate disturbance on ecohydrology in mesic temperate forests with a unique methodological approach that assessed the impacts of spatially heterogeneous and repeated moderate disturbance at a regional scale.},

	issn = {1354-1013},
	doi = {10.1111/gcb.16060},
	abstract = {Research in global change ecology relies heavily on global climatic grids derived from estimates of air temperature in open areas at around 2 m above the ground. These climatic grids do not reflect conditions below vegetation canopies and near the ground surface, where critical ecosystem functions occur and most terrestrial species reside. Here, we provide global maps of soil temperature and bioclimatic variables at a 1-km² resolution for 0-5 and 5-15 cm soil depth. These maps were created by calculating the difference (i.e., offset) between in-situ soil temperature measurements, based on time series from over 1200 1-km² pixels (summarized from 8500 unique temperature sensors) across all the world's major terrestrial biomes, and coarse-grained air temperature estimates from ERA5-Land (an atmospheric reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). We show that mean annual soil temperature differs markedly from the corresponding gridded air temperature, by up to 10°C (mean = 3.0 ± 2.1°C), with substantial variation across biomes and seasons. Over the year, soils in cold and/or dry biomes are substantially warmer (+3.6 ± 2.3°C) than gridded air temperature, whereas soils in warm and humid environments are on average slightly cooler (-0.7 ± 2.3°C). The observed substantial and biome-specific offsets emphasize that the projected impacts of climate and climate change on near-surface biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are inaccurately assessed when air rather than soil temperature is used, especially in cold environments. The global soil-related bioclimatic variables provided here are an important step forward for any application in ecology and related disciplines. Nevertheless, we highlight the need to fill remaining geographic gaps by collecting more in-situ measurements of microclimate conditions to further enhance the spatiotemporal resolution of global soil temperature products for ecological applications.},

	abstract = {Forest canopies can buffer seedlings from extreme climate conditions. Yet, how disturbed forest canopies influence microclimate is not well understood, despite the important implications of microclimate for seedling establishment and post-disturbance successional trajectories. Better understanding of the relationship between a forest canopy and sub-canopy temperature and moisture conditions requires easily acquired and continuous forest canopy data, which is increasingly available due to new technology. Here, we measured canopy height using a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) and monitored microclimate with low-cost temperature and soil moisture sensors in a sub-boreal forest impacted by fires of variable severity. We used regression models to investigate how differences in canopy height influenced microclimate variables. Mean growing season temperatures at -8 cm (soil), 0 cm (surface), and 15 cm (near-surface) relative to the ground surface were higher under shorter more disturbed canopies. Soil temperature was most sensitive to canopy height differences: linear models for the observed data range predicted a 2.0 °C increase in mean growing season soil temperature with every 10 m decrease in canopy height. We observed a weak negative relationship between canopy height and mean growing season soil moisture. We found that canopy height summarized at moderate resolution (15 m) better explained differences in temperature in our disturbed landscape. This work informs future methods to produce gridded microclimate datasets and outlines the impact of disturbed forest structure on microclimate variables. Our results show that the characteristics of the forest canopy remaining after a burn impact microclimates, which has important implications for post-fire ecosystems.},
