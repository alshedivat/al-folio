  abstract   = {In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  author      = {Qin, Shuyu and Guo, Yichen and Kaliyev, Alibek T and Agar,

  abstract    = {Machine learning (ML) is relied on for materials spectroscopy.
                 It is challenging to make ML models fail because statistical
                 correlations can mimic the physics without causality. Here,
                 using a benchmark band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy
                 polarization spectroscopy (BEPS) dataset the pitfalls of the
                 so-called ``better'', ``faster'', and ``less-biased'' ML of
                 electromechanical switching are demonstrated and overcome. Using
                 a toy and real experimental dataset, it is demonstrated how
                 linear nontemporal ML methods result in physically reasonable
                 embedding (eigenvalues) while producing nonsensical eigenvectors
                 and generated spectra, promoting misleading interpretations. A
                 new method of unsupervised multimodal hyperspectral analysis of
                 BEPS is demonstrated using long-short-term memory (LSTM)
                 $\beta$-variational autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs) . By including
                 LSTM neurons, the ordinal nature of ferroelectric switching is
                 considered. To improve the interpretability of the latent space,
                 a variational Kullback-Leibler-divergency regularization is
                 imposed . Finally, regularization scheduling of $\beta$ as a
                 disentanglement metric is leveraged to reduce user bias.
                 Combining these experiment-inspired modifications enables the
                 automated detection of ferroelectric switching mechanisms,
                 including a complex two-step, three-state one. Ultimately, this
                 work provides a robust ML method for the rapid discovery of
                 electromechanical switching mechanisms in ferroelectrics and is
                 applicable to other multimodal hyperspectral materials

  abstract    = {Ferroelectrics are being increasingly called upon for electronic
                 devices in extreme environments. Device performance and energy
                 efficiency is highly correlated to clock frequency, operational
                 voltage, and resistive loss. To increase performance it is
                 common to engineer ferroelectric domain structure with
                 highly-correlated electrical and elastic coupling that elicit
                 fast and efficient collective switching. Designing domain
                 structures with advantageous properties is difficult because the
                 mechanisms involved in collective switching are poorly
                 understood and difficult to investigate. Collective switching is
                 a hierarchical process where the nano- and mesoscale responses
                 control the macroscopic properties. Using chemical solution
                 synthesis, epitaxially nearly-relaxed (100) BaTiO3 films are
                 synthesized. Thermal strain induces a strongly-correlated domain
                 structure with alternating domains of polarization along the
                 [010] and [001] in-plane axes and 90° domain walls along the
                 [011] or [01 1 \textasciimacron{} $\bar\{1\}$ ] directions.
                 Simultaneous capacitance-voltage measurements and
                 band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy revealed strong
                 collective switching behavior. Using a deep convolutional
                 autoencoder, hierarchical switching is automatically tracked and
                 the switching pathway is identified. The collective switching
                 velocities are calculated to be $\approx$500 cm s-1 at 5 V (7 kV
                 cm-1 ), orders-of-magnitude faster than expected. These
                 combinations of properties are promising for high-speed tunable

  abstract    = {Ferroelectric materials exhibit spontaneous polarization that can be switched by electric field. Beyond traditional applications as nonvolatile capacitive elements, the interplay between polarization and electronic transport in ferroelectric thin films has enabled a path to neuromorphic device applications involving resistive switching. 
                 A fundamental challenge, however, is that finite electronic conductivity may introduce considerable power dissipation and perhaps destabilize ferroelectricity itself. 
                 Here, tunable microwave frequency electronic response of domain walls injected into ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate (PbZr<sub>0.2</sub>Ti<sub>0.8</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) on the level of a single nanodomain is revealed. 
                 Tunable microwave response is detected through first-order reversal curve spectroscopy combined with scanning microwave impedance microscopy measurements taken near 3 GHz. 
                 Contributions of film interfaces to the measured AC conduction through subtractive milling, where the film exhibited improved conduction properties after removal of surface layers, 
                 are investigated. Using statistical analysis and finite element modeling, we inferred that the mechanism of tunable microwave conductance is the variable area of the domain wall in the switching volume. 
                 These observations open the possibilities for ferroelectric memristors or volatile resistive switches, localized to several tens of nanometers and operating according to well-defined dynamics under an applied field.},

  title       = {Symmetry-aware recursive image similarity exploration for
                 materials microscopy},

  abstract    = {AbstractIn pursuit of scientific discovery, vast collections of
                 unstructured structural and functional images are acquired;
                 however, only an infinitesimally small fraction of this data is
                 rigorously analyzed, with an even smaller fraction ever being
                 published. One method to accelerate scientific discovery is to
                 extract more insight from costly scientific experiments already
                 conducted. Unfortunately, data from scientific experiments tend
                 only to be accessible by the originator who knows the
                 experiments and directives. Moreover, there are no robust
                 methods to search unstructured databases of images to deduce
                 correlations and insight. Here, we develop a machine learning
                 approach to create image similarity projections to search
                 unstructured image databases. To improve these projections, we
                 develop and train a model to include symmetry-aware features. As
                 an exemplar, we use a set of 25,133 piezoresponse force
                 microscopy images collected on diverse materials systems over
                 five years. We demonstrate how this tool can be used for
                 interactive recursive image searching and exploration,
                 highlighting structural similarities at various length scales.
                 This tool justifies continued investment in federated scientific
                 databases with standardized metadata schemas where the
                 combination of filtering and recursive interactive searching can
                 uncover synthesis-structure-property relations. We provide a
                 customizable open-source package
                 (https://github.com/m3-learning/Recursive\_Symmetry\_Aware\_Materials\_Microstructure\_Explorer)
                 of this interactive tool for researchers to use with their data.},
