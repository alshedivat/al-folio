	abstract = {Synthesisers, in their many forms, enable the realisation of almost any conceivable sound. Their fine-grained control and broad timbral palette call for a descriptive lexicon to enable their verbal differentiation and discussion. While acoustic instruments of the western classical lineage are the subject of an extensive body of enquiry into the perceptual attributes and semantic associations of the sounds they produce, abstract electronic sounds have been comparatively understudied in this regard. In particular, the diverse vocabulary used to describe such classical acoustic instruments can be summarised with three conceptual metaphors—such musical tones have luminance, texture, and mass—but this has yet to be explicitly confirmed for the kinds of electronic sounds that pervade many modern sonic cultures. In this work, we present an experimental paradigm for studying the semantic associations of synthesised sounds, wherein a group of experienced music producers and sound designers interacted with a web-based synthesiser in response to descriptive prompts, and provided comparative semantic ratings on the sounds they created. The words used for semantic ratings were selected by mining a text corpus from the popular modular synthesis forum Muff Wiggler, and analysing the frequency of adjectives in contexts pertaining to timbre. The ratings provided by participants were subject to statistical analysis. From 27 initial adjectives, two underlying semantic factors were revealed: terms including aggressive, hard, and complex associated with the first, and dark and warm with the second. These factors differ from those found for classical acoustic sounds, implying a relationship between the qualia of a sonic experience and the language employed to talk about it. Such insight has implications for how sound is conceptualised, understood, and received within sonic cultures—in particular, those predicated on electronic or abstract sound—and applications in developing novel control schemes for synthesis methods.}}

	abstract = {Brightness has been long shown to play a major role in timbre perception but relatively little is known about the specific acoustic and cognitive factors that affect brightness ratings of musical instrument sounds. Previous work indicated that sound source categories influence general timbre dissimilarity ratings. To examine whether source categories also exert an effect on brightness ratings of timbre, we collected brightness dissimilarity ratings of 14 orchestral instrument tones from 40 musically experienced listeners and the data were modeled using a partial least-squares regression model that takes audio descriptors of timbre as regressors. It was found that adding predictors derived from sound source categories did not improve the model fit, indicating that timbral brightness is informed mainly by continuously varying properties of the acoustic signal. A multidimensional scaling analysis suggested at least two salient cues: spectral energy distribution and attack time and/or asynchrony in the rise of harmonics. This finding seems to challenge the typical approach of seeking acoustical correlates of brightness in the spectral envelope of the steady-state portion of sounds. To further investigate these aspects in timbral brightness perception, a new group of 40 musically experienced listeners will perform MUSHRA-like brightness ratings of an expanded set of 24 orchestral instrument notes. The goal is to obtain a perceptual scaling of the attribute across a larger set of sounds to help delineate the acoustic ingredients of this important aspect of timbre perception. Preliminary results indicate that between sounds with very close spectral centroid values but different attack times, those with faster attacks tend to be perceived as brighter. Overall, these experiments help clarify the relation between two salient dimensions of timbre: onset and spectral energy distribution.},

	abstract = {Imagine listening to the famous soprano Maria Callas (1923–1977) singing the aria “Vissi d’arte” from Puccini’s Tosca. How would you describe the quality of her voice? When describing the timbre of musical sounds, listeners use descriptions such as bright, heavy, round, and rough, among others. In 1890, Stumpf theorized that this diverse vocabulary can be summarized, on the basis of semantic proximities, by three pairs of opposites: dark–bright, soft–rough, and full–empty. Empirical findings across many semantic differential studies from the late 1950s until today have generally confirmed that these are the salient dimensions of timbre semantics. However, most prior work has considered only orchestral instruments, with relatively little attention given to sung tones. At the same time, research on the perception of singing voice quality has primarily focused on verbal attributes associated with phonation type, voice classification, vocal register, vowel intelligibility, and vibrato. Descriptions like pressed, soprano, falsetto, hoarse, or wobble, albeit in themselves a type of timbre semantics, are essentially sound source identifiers acting as semantic descriptors. It remains an open question as to whether the timbral attributes of sung tones, that is verbal attributes that bear no source associations, can be described adequately on the basis of the bright-rough-full semantic space. We present a meta-analysis of previous research on verbal attributes of singing voice timbre that covers not only pedagogical texts but also work from music cognition, psychoacoustics, music information retrieval, musicology, and ethnomusicology. The meta-analysis lays the groundwork for a semantic differential study of sung sounds, providing a more appropriate lexicon on which to draw than simply using verbal scales from related work on instrumental timbre. The meta-analysis will be complemented by a psycholinguistic analysis of free verbalizations provided by singing teachers in a listening test and an acoustic analysis of the tested stimuli.},

	abstract = {Timbre is often described as a complex set of sound features that are not accounted for by pitch, loudness, duration, spatial location, and the acoustic environment. Musical dynamics refers to the perceived or intended loudness of a played note, instructed in music notation as piano or forte (soft or loud) with different dynamic gradations between and beyond. Recent research has shown that even if no loudness cues are available, listeners can still quite reliably identify the intended dynamic strength of a performed sound by relying on timbral features. More recently, acoustical analyses across an extensive set of anechoic recordings of orchestral instrument notes played at pianissimo (pp) and fortissimo (ff) showed that attack slope, spectral skewness, and spectral flatness together explained 72% of the variance in dynamic strength across all instruments, and 89% with an instrument-specific model. Here, we further investigate the role of timbre in musical dynamics, focusing specifically on the contribution of spectral and temporal modulations. Loudness-normalized modulation power spectra (MPS) were used as input representation for a convolutional neural network (CNN). Through visualization of the pp and ff saliency maps of the CNN it was possible to identify discriminant regions of the MPS and define a novel task-specific scalar audio descriptor. A linear discriminant analysis with 10-fold cross-validation using this new MPS-based descriptor on the entire dataset performed better than using the two spectral descriptors (27% error rate reduction). Overall, audio descriptors based on different regions of the MPS could serve as sound representation for machine listening applications, as well as to better delineate the acoustic ingredients of different aspects of auditory perception.},

Model performance reached 93% for the outdoor and 87% for the indoor environments (expressed in weighted AUROC), demonstrating the potential of the approach. Estimating the density distributions of the most predictive biomarkers, we present a series of geographic and temporal visualizations depicting the environmental contexts in which the most intense affective and cognitive reactions take place. A linear mixed model analysis revealed significant differences between categories of vision impairment, but not between normal and impaired vision. Despite the limited size of our cohort, these findings pave the way to emotionally intelligent mobility-enhancing systems, capable of implicit adaptation not only to changing environments but also to shifts in the affective state of the user in relation to different environmental and situational factors.},

We now have a better scientific understanding of how human sensation and perception function both in the brain and in interaction than ever before. However, there is little research on how this high level scientific understanding is translated into knowledge for the public more widely. We present descriptive results from a simple survey and compare how public understanding and perception of sensory experience lines up with scientific understanding. Results show that even in a sample with fairly high educational attainment, many respondents were unaware of fairly common forms of sensory variation. In line with the well-documented under representation of sign languages within linguistics, respondents tended to under-estimate the number of sign languages in the world. We outline how our results represent gaps in public understanding of sensory variation, and argue that filling these gaps can form an important early intervention, acting as a basic foundation for improving acceptance, inclusivity, and accessibility for cognitively diverse populations.},

As a result, the extent to which spectral modifications due to the outer ear interact with timbre perception is not fully understood. As a first step towards investigating this research question, we examine here whether timbre descriptors calculated using HRTF filtered instrumental sounds deviate across ears and from values obtained from the same sounds without HRTF filtering for different listeners. The sound set comprised isolated notes played at the same fundamental frequency and dynamic from a database of anechoic recordings of modern orchestral instruments and some of their classical and baroque precursors. These were convolved with anechoic high spatial resolution HRTFs of human listeners. We present results and discuss implications for research on timbre perception and cognition.},

We extract a set of lyrical features related to each song's overarching narrative, moral valence, sentiment, and emotion. A machine learning framework was designed to exploit regression approaches and evaluate the predictive power of lyrical features for inferring moral values. Results suggest that lyrics from top songs of artists people like inform their morality. Virtues of hierarchy and tradition achieve higher prediction scores (between .20 and .30) than values of empathy and equality (between .08 and .11), while basic demographic variables only account for a small part in the models' explainability. This shows the importance of music listening behaviours, as assessed via lyrical preferences, alone in capturing moral values. We discuss the technological and musicological implications and possible future improvements.},

We exploit both classification and regression approaches to assess the predictive power of music preferences for the prediction of demographic attributes as well as the moral values of the participants. Our findings point out that moral values are hard to predict (.62 AUROC_avg) solely by the music listening behaviours, while if basic sociodemographic information is provided the prediction score rises to 4% on average (.66 AUROC_avg), with the Purity foundation to be the one that is steadily the one with the highest accuracy scores. Similar results are obtained from the regression analysis. Finally, we provide with insights on the most predictive music behaviours associated with each moral value that can inform a wide range of applications from rehabilitation practices to communication campaign design.},

However, both preference and richness ratings varied widely between individual violinists, likely because musicians conceptualize the same attribute in different ways. To better understand how richness is conceptualized by violinists and how it contributes to the perceived quality of a violin, we analyzed free verbal descriptions collected during a carefully controlled playing task (involving 16 violinists) and in an online survey where no sound examples or other contextual information was present (involving 34 violinists). The analysis was based on a psycholinguistic method, whereby semantic categories are inferred from the verbal data itself through syntactic context and linguistic markers. The main sensory property related to violin sound richness was expressed through words such as full, complex, and dense versus thin and small, referring to the perceived number of partials present in the sound. Another sensory property was expressed through words such as warm, velvety, and smooth versus strident, harsh, and tinny, alluding to spectral energy distribution cues. Haptic cues were also implicated in the conceptualization of violin sound richness.},

We present Seeing Music, a digital interactive exhibition and audiovisual game that translates high-level scientific understanding of sensory variation and cross-modality into knowledge for the public. Using a narrative-driven gamified approach, players are tasked with communicating human music to an extraterrestrial intelligence through visual shape, color and texture using two-dimensional selector panels. Music snippets (12--24 s long) are played continuously in a loop, taken from three custom instrumental compositions designed to vary systematically in terms of timbre, melody, and rhythm. Players can ``level-up'' to unlock new visual features and musical snippets, and explore and evaluate collaborative visualizations made by others. Outside the game, a series of interactive slideshows help visitors learn more about sensory experience, sensory diversity, and how our senses make us human.

To date, 169 players of Seeing Music have produced more than 42,500 audiovisual mapping datapoints for scientific research purposes. Preliminary analysis suggests that music with less high-frequency energy was mapped to less complex and rounder shapes, bluer and less bright hues, and less dense textures. These trends confirm auditory-visual correspondences previously reported in more controlled laboratory studies, while also offering new insight into how different auditory-visual associations interact with each other.

	abstract = {As evidenced by a large body of literature, the gender-stereotyped nature of toy adverts has been widely scrutinised. However, little work has been done in examining the affective impact of these commercials on the audience. It has been proven that repeated exposure to gender-stereotyped messages has the capacity to influence behaviours, beliefs and attitudes. In particular, media can influence emotion socialization, and gender differences in emotion expression might emerge (Scherr 2018). In this study, we investigated whether commercials elicit emotions at different intensities with respect to the gender of their target audience. Furthermore, we evaluated whether such emotions follow distinct underlying latent structures. A total of 1081 ratings of 10 unipolar aesthetic emotion scales were collected for 135 commercials (45 for each masculine, feminine, and mixed target audience) from 80 UK nationals (35 F, 45 M) aged 18 to 76. The main reason for collecting our ratings from adults was that, already by age 11, children exhibit adult-like emotion recognition capabilities (Hunter 2011). Seven scales showed significant differences between commercials for distinct audiences; with five, in particular, revealing a strong polarization (happiness, amusement, beauty, calm, and anger). In addition, parallel analysis showed that a minimum of three factors are needed to explain the ratings for masculine and mixed targeted commercials, while only two are needed for the feminine ones, thereby indicating that the latter elicit emotions following a simpler underlying structure. Both results reflect larger issues in toy marketing, where gender essentialism is still dominant, and prompt further discussion and research.},

It is unclear whether insights from these studies generalise to electronic sounds, nor is it obvious how these relate to the creation of such sounds. In this work, we present an experiment on the semantic associations of sounds produced by FM synthesis with the aim of identifying whether existing models of timbre semantics are appropriate for such sounds. We applied a novel experimental paradigm in which experienced sound designers responded to semantic prompts by programming a synthesiser, and provided semantic ratings on the sounds they created. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a five-dimensional semantic space. The first two factors mapped well to the concepts of luminance, texture, and mass. The remaining three factors did not have clear parallels, but correlation analysis with acoustic descriptors suggested an acoustical relationship to luminance and texture. Our results suggest that further enquiry into the timbres of disembodied electronic sounds, their synthesis, and their semantic associations would be worthwhile, and that this could benefit research into auditory perception and cognition, as well as synthesis control and audio engineering.},

The NEWT uses time-distributed multilayer perceptrons with periodic activations to implicitly learn nonlinear transfer functions that encode the characteristics of a target timbre. Once trained, a NEWT can produce complex timbral evolutions by simple affine transformations of its input and output signals. We paired the NEWT with a differentiable noise synthesiser and reverb and found it capable of generating realistic musical instrument performances with only 260k total model parameters, conditioned on F0 and loudness features. We compared our method to state-of-the-art benchmarks with a multi-stimulus listening test and the Fr{\'e}chet Audio Distance and found it performed competitively across the tested timbral domains. Our method significantly outperformed the benchmarks in terms of generation speed, and achieved real-time performance on a consumer CPU, both with and without FastNEWT, suggesting it is a viable basis for future creative sound design tools.},

	abstract = {Research on timbre perception is typically conducted under controlled laboratory conditions where every effort is made to maintain stimulus presentation conditions fixed (McAdams, 2019). This conforms with the ANSI (1973) definition of timbre suggesting that in order to judge the timbre differences between a pair of sounds the rest perceptual attributes (i.e., pitch, duration and loudness) should remain unchanged. Therefore, especially in pairwise dissimilarity studies, particular care is taken to ensure that loudness is not used by participants as a criterion for judgements by equalising it across experimental stimuli. On the other hand, conducting online experiments is an increasingly favoured practice in the music perception and cognition field as targeting relevant communities can potentially provide a large number of suitable participants with relatively little time investment from the side of the experimenters (e.g., Woods et al., 2015). However, the strict requirements for stimuli preparation and presentation prevents timbre studies from conducting online experimentation. Despite the obvious difficulties in imposing equal loudness on online experiments, the different playback equipment chain (DACs, pre-amplifiers, headphones) will also almost inevitably `colour' the sonic outcome in a different way. Despite the above limitations, in a social distancing time like this, it would be of major importance to be able to lift some of the physical requirements in order to carry on conducting behavioural research on timbre perception. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the extent to which an uncontrolled online replication of a past laboratory-conducted pairwise dissimilarity task will distort the findings.},

Query by Vocal Percussion (QVP) is a subfield in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) that explores techniques to query percussive sounds using vocal imitations as input, usually plosive consonant sounds. The goal of this work was to investigate timbral relationships between real drum sounds and their vocal imitations. We believe these insights could shed light on how to select timbre descriptors for extraction when designing offline and online QVP systems. In particular, we studied a dataset composed of 30 acoustic and electronic drum sound recordings and vocal imitations of each sound performed by 14 musicians. Our approach was to study the correlation of audio content descriptors of timbre extracted from the drum samples with the same descriptors taken from vocal imitations. Three timbral descriptors were selected: the Log Attack Time (LAT), the Spectral Centroid (SC), and the Derivative After Maximum of the sound envelope (DAM). LAT and SC have been shown to represent salient dimensions of timbre across different types of sounds including percussion. In this sense, one intriguing question would be to what extent listeners can communicate these salient timbral cues in vocal imitations. The third descriptor, DAM, was selected for its role in describing the sound's tail, which we considered to be a relevant part of percussive utterances.},

From a psychoacoustic perspective, brightness ratings of instrumental timbres as well as music excerpts systematically correlate with the centre of gravity of the spectral envelope and thus brightness as a semantic descriptor of musical sound has come to denote a prevalence of high-frequency over low-frequency energy. However, relatively little is known about the higher-level cognitive processes underpinning musical brightness ratings. Psycholinguistic investigations of verbal descriptions of timbre suggest a more complex, polysemic picture (Saitis & Weinzierl 2019) that warrants further research. To better understand how musical brightness is conceptualised by listeners, here we analysed free verbal descriptions collected along brightness ratings of short music snippets (involving 69 listeners) and brightness ratings of orchestral instrument notes (involving 68 listeners). Such knowledge can help delineate the intrinsic structure of brightness as a perceptual attribute of musical sounds, and has broad implications and applications in orchestration, audio engineering, and music psychology.},

The centroid dimension is traditionally considered as reflecting timbral brightness. However, the question of whether multiple continuous acoustical and/or categorical cues influence brightness perception has not been addressed comprehensively. A triangulation approach was used to examine the dimensionality of timbral brightness, its robustness across different psychoacoustical contexts, and relation to perception of the sounds' source-cause. Listeners compared 14 acoustic instrument sounds in three distinct tasks that collected general dissimilarity, brightness dissimilarity, and direct multi-stimulus brightness ratings. Results confirmed that brightness is a robust unitary auditory dimension, with direct ratings recovering the centroid dimension of general dissimilarity. When a two-dimensional space of brightness dissimilarity was considered, its second dimension correlated with the attack-time dimension of general dissimilarity, which was interpreted as reflecting a potential infiltration of the latter into brightness dissimilarity. Dissimilarity data were further modeled using partial least-squares regression with audio descriptors as predictors. Adding predictors derived from instrument family and the type of resonator and excitation did not improve the model fit, indicating that brightness perception is underpinned primarily by acoustical rather than source-cause cues.},

The proposed CNN architecture obtained competitive results in three classification tasks with all three input representations. In order to compare the different input representations, the test sets in three experiments were partitioned in order to promote or avoid selection bias. When selection bias was avoided, models trained on MPS were outperformed by those trained on time-frequency representations, conversely, those trained on MPS achieved the best results when selection bias was promoted. Low-temporal modulations emerged in classspecific MPS saliency maps as markers of musical dynamics.

Comparisons with similarity-based multidimensional models confirm the strong link between perceiving timbre and talking about it.

Auditory models of both temporal and spectral information can be related to aspects of timbre perception, whereas the excitation-filter model of sound production provides links to the acoustics of sound production. A brief review of the most common representations of audio signals used to extract audio descriptors related to timbre is followed by a discussion of the audio descriptor extraction process using those representations. This chapter covers traditional temporal and spectral descriptors, including harmonic description, time-varying descriptors, and techniques for descriptor selection and descriptor decomposition. The discussion is focused on conceptual aspects of the acoustic modeling of timbre and the relationship between the descriptors and timbre perception, semantics, and cognition, including illustrative examples. The applications covered in this chapter range from timbre psychoacoustics and multimedia descriptions to computer-aided orchestration and sound morphing. Finally, the chapter concludes with speculation on the role of deep learning in the future of timbre description and on the challenges of audio content descriptors of timbre.},

	abstract = {Brightness is among the most studied aspects of timbre perception. Psychoacoustically, sounds described as ''bright'' vs ''dark'' typically exhibit a high vs low frequency emphasis in the spectrum. However, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms that facilitate these ``metaphors we listen with.'' Do they originate in universal mental representations common to more than one sensory modality? Triangulating three different interaction paradigms, we investigated using speeded identification whether unimodal and crossmodal interference occurs when timbral brightness, as modelled by the centroid of the spectral envelope, and 1) pitch height, 2) visual brightness, 3) numerical value processing are semantically incongruent. In three online pilot tasks, 58 participants were presented a baseline stimulus (a pitch, gray square, or numeral) then asked to quickly identify a target stimulus that is higher/lower, brighter/darker, or greater/less than the baseline, respectively, after being primed with a bright or dark synthetic harmonic tone. Additionally, in the pitch and visual tasks, a deceptive same-target condition was included. Results suggest that timbral brightness modulates the perception of pitch and visual brightness, but not numerical value. Semantically incongruent pitch height-timbral brightness shifts produced significantly slower choice reaction time and higher error compared to congruent pairs; timbral brightness also had a strong biasing effect in the same-target condition (i.e., people heard the same pitch as higher when the target tone was timbrally brighter than the baseline, and vice versa with darker tones). In the visual task, incongruent pairings of gray squares and tones elicited slower choice reaction times than congruent pairings. No interference was observed in the number comparison task. We are currently following up on these results with a larger online replication sample, and an fMRI study to investigate the relevant neural mechanisms. Our findings shed light on the multisensory nature of experiencing timbre.},
