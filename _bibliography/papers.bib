  abstract  = {Over the last few years Literature-based Discovery (LBD) has regained popularity as a means to enhance the scientific research process. The resurgent interest has spurred the development of supervised and semi-supervised machine learning models aimed at making previously implicit connections between scientific concepts/entities explicit based on often extensive repositories of published literature. Understanding the temporally evolving interactions between these entities can provide valuable information for predicting the future development of entity relationships. However, existing methods often underutilize the latent information embedded in the temporal aspects of interaction data. In this context, motivated by applications in the food domain—where we aim to connect nutritional information with health-related benefits—we address the hypothesis-generation problem using a temporal graph-based approach. Given that hypothesis generation involves predicting future (i.e., still to be discovered) entity connections, the ability to capture the dynamic evolution of connections over time is pivotal for a robust model. To address this, we introduce THiGER, a novel batch contrastive temporal node-pair embedding method. THiGER excels in providing a more expressive node-pair encoding by effectively harnessing node-pair relationships. Furthermore, we present THiGER-A, an incremental training approach that incorporates an active curriculum learning strategy to mitigate label bias arising from unobserved connections. By progressively training on increasingly challenging and high-utility samples, our approach significantly enhances the performance of the embedding model. Empirical validation of our proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness on established temporal-graph benchmark datasets, as well as on real-world datasets within the food domain.},

  abstract  = {Deep neural networks trained on biased data often inadvertently learn unintended inference rules, particularly when labels are strongly correlated with biased features. Existing bias mitigation methods typically involve either a) predefining bias types and enforcing them as prior knowledge or b) reweighting training samples to emphasize bias-conflicting samples over bias-aligned samples. However, both strategies address bias indirectly in the feature or sample space, with no control over learned weights, making it difficult to control the bias propagation across different layers. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel approach to address bias directly in the model's parameter space, preventing its propagation across layers. Our method involves training two models: a bias model for biased features and a debias model for unbiased details, guided by the bias model. We enforce dissimilarity in the debias model's later layers and similarity in its initial layers with the bias model, ensuring it learns unbiased low-level features without adopting biased high-level abstractions. By incorporating this explicit constraint during training, our approach shows enhanced classification accuracy and debiasing effectiveness across various synthetic and real-world datasets of different sizes. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates robustness across different bias types and percentages of biased samples in the training data.},

Recently, KGC using KG embedding (KGE) models, primarily based on complex architectures (e.g., transformers), have achieved remarkable performance. Still, extracting the \emph{minimal and relevant} information employed by KGE models to make predictions, while constituting a major part of \emph{explaining the predictions}, remains a challenge. While there exists a growing literature on explainers for trained KGE models, systematically exposing and quantifying their failure cases poses even greater challenges. In this work, we introduce two synthetic datasets, FRUNI and FTREE, designed to demonstrate the (in)ability of explainer methods to spot link predictions that rely on indirectly connected links. Notably, we empower practitioners to control various aspects of the datasets, such as noise levels and dataset size, enabling them to assess the performance of explainability methods across diverse scenarios. Through our experiments, we assess the performance of four recent explainers in providing accurate explanations for predictions on the proposed datasets. We believe that these datasets are valuable resources for further validating explainability methods within the knowledge graph community.},

  abstract  = {For humans and other animals, the sense of smell provides crucial information in many situations of everyday life. Still, the study of olfactory perception has received only limited attention outside of the biological sciences. From an AI perspective, the complexity of the interactions between olfactory receptors and volatile molecules and the scarcity of comprehensive olfactory datasets, present unique challenges in this sensory domain. Previous works have explored the relationship between molecular structure and odor descriptors using fully supervised training approaches. However, these methods are data-intensive and poorly generalize due to labeled data scarcity, particularly for rare-class samples. Our study partially tackles the challenges of data scarcity and label skewness through multimodal transfer learning. We investigate the potential of large molecular foundation models trained on extensive unlabeled molecular data to effectively model olfactory perception. Additionally, we explore the integration of different molecular representations, including molecular graphs and text-based SMILES encodings, to achieve data efficiency and generalization of the learned model, particularly on sparsely represented classes. By leveraging complementary representations, we aim to learn robust perceptual features of odorants. However, we observe that traditional methods of combining modalities do not yield substantial gains in high-dimensional skewed label spaces. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel label-balancer technique specifically designed for high-dimensional multi-label and multi-modal training.  The label-balancer technique distributes learning objectives across modalities to optimize collaboratively for distinct subsets of labels. Our results suggest that multi-modal transfer features learned using the label-balancer technique are more effective and robust, surpassing the capabilities of traditional uni- or multi-modal approaches, particularly on rare-class samples.},

  abstract  = {Defining perceptual similarity metrics for odorant comparisons is crucial to understanding the mechanism of olfactory perception. Current methods in olfaction rely on molecular physicochemical features or discrete verbal descriptors (floral,  burnt, etc.) to approximate perceptual (dis)similarity between odorants. However, structural or verbal descriptors alone are limited in modeling complex nuances of odor perception. While structural features inadequately characterize odor perception, language-based discrete descriptors lack the granularity needed to model a continuous perception space. We introduce data-driven approaches to perceptual metrics learning (PMeL) based on two key insights: a) by combining physicochemical features with the user's perceptual feedback, we can leverage both structural and perceptual attributes of odors to define dissimilarity, and b) instead of discrete labels, user's perceptual feedback can be gathered as relative similarity comparisons, such as ``Does molecule-A smell more like molecule-B, or molecule-C?" These triplet comparisons are easier even for non-experts users and offer a more effective representation of the continuous perception space. Experimental results on several defined tasks show the effectiveness of our approach in evaluating perceptual dissimilarity between odorants. Finally, we investigate how closely our model, trained on non-expert feedback, aligns with the expert's similarity judgments. Our effort aims to reduce reliance on expert annotations.},

This paper experiments with different sensory fea- tures for several olfactory perception tasks. We investigate the multilabel classification of aroma molecules in odor descriptors. We investigate single-label classification not only in fine-grained odor descriptors ("orange," "waxy," etc.) but also in odor descriptor groups. We created a database of odor vectors for 114 aroma molecules to conduct our experiments using a QCM (Quartz Crystal Microbalance) type smell sensor module (Aroma Coder®V2 Set). We compare these smell features with different baseline features to evaluate the cluster composition, considering the frequencies of the top odor descriptors carried by the aroma molecules. Experimental results suggest a statistically significant better performance of the QCM-type smell sensor module compared with other baseline features with the F1 evaluation metric.},

  abstract     = {Active metric learning is the problem of incrementally selecting high-utility batches of 
                  training data (typically, ordered triplets) to annotate, in order to 
                  progressively improve a learned model of a metric over some input domain 
                  as rapidly as possible. Standard approaches, which independently assess 
                  the informativeness of each triplet in a batch, are susceptible to highly 
                  correlated batches with many redundant triplets and hence low overall utility. 
                  While a recent work proposes batch-decorrelation strategies for metric 
                  learning, they rely on ad hoc heuristics to estimate the correlation between 
                  two triplets at a time. We present a novel batch active metric learning method 
                  that leverages the Maximum Entropy Principle to learn the least biased 
                  estimate of triplet distribution for a given set of prior constraints. 
                  To avoid redundancy between triplets, our method collectively selects batches 
                  with maximum joint entropy, which simultaneously captures both informativeness 
                  and diversity. We take advantage of the submodularity of the joint entropy 
                  function to construct a tractable solution using an efficient greedy 
                  algorithm based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization that is provably

Therefore, we approximate the 3D surface locally by a 2D plane using an area preserving mapping technique - Gall-Peters mapping.
