title = {{Finite element analysis of cable-stayed bridges under the effect of accidental loss of a stay cable}},
year={2013},
abstract={One of the main structural components of cable-stayed bridges is the post-tensioned stay cables, which stretch diagonally from the pylons to support the horizontal deck. These essential members may be lost due to vehicular collision, excessive corrosion of connections, or wind dynamic forces. Design code provisions generally require that the bridge is designed considering the likely event of accidental loss of any one cable. However, the effect of this loss has not been studied in great detail. The present paper is part of a series of extensive parametric static and dynamic studies aimed at developing efficient design rules. In the paper, the response of a cable-stayed bridge to accidental breakage of any one stay cable is investigated. A comprehensive 3-D finite element model of the bridge is developed to provide realistic member internal actions. A 3-D cable element is utilized to represent the stay cables, and geometric nonlinearities are accounted for in the study. The static effect of loss of a stay cable on the structural behaviour of the deck is examined. The study builds on previously developed in-house optimisation method for evaluating the optimum post-tensioning cable forces.},

title = {{Seismic behaviour of multi-storey buildings with asymmetric setback -The effect of the level and the degree of setback}},
year = {2014},
abstract={Multi-storey buildings with asymmetric setbacks possess both vertical and in-plan irregularities.
The former is due to the abrupt changes in the plan dimension at the level of the setback while the latter
results from the asymmetry between the upper tower portion and the lower base portion. These
irregularities introduce mass, stiffness and resistance eccentricities in the structure. As a result, the
structural behaviour under lateral seismic excitation in the direction perpendicular to the setback is
coupled in translation-torsion, which could increase the demand on the structural response. This coupling
behaviour has not been studied in detail, and its effect is largely ignored by many conventional seismic
design methods. In this research, the effects of both the degree and level of setback on the seismic
response of multi-storey building frames were evaluated. The degree of setback refers to the ratio of the
plan area of the lower base portion to the plan area of the upper tower. An analytical study was carried
out to identify the governing parameters of the structural behaviour and their effects on the overall
response of setback buildings. A total of nine different configurations were examined. The study showed
that both the degree and level of setback have a considerable influence on the overall seismic behaviour
of asymmetric setback buildings loaded in the direction perpendicular to the setback.},
