  abstract={A simple and scalable denoising algorithm is proposed that can be applied to a wide range of source and noise models. At the core of the proposed CUDE algorithm is symbol-by-symbol universal denoising used by the celebrated DUDE algorithm, whereby the optimal estimate of the source from an unknown distribution is computed by inverting the empirical distribution of the noisy observation sequence by a deep neural network, which naturally and implicitly aggregates multi-pie contexts of similar characteristics and estimates the conditional distribution more accurately. The performance of CUDE is evaluated for grayscale images of varying bit depths, which improves upon DUDE and its recent neural network based extension, Neural DUDE.},

  abstract={A new approach to $L_2$-consistent estimation of a general density functional using k-nearest neighbor distances is proposed, where the functional under consideration is in the form of the expectation of some function f of the densities at each point. The estimator is designed to be asymptotically unbiased, using the convergence of the normalized volume of a $k$-nearest neighbor ball to a Gamma distribution in the large-sample limit, and naturally involves the inverse Laplace transform of a scaled version of the function $f$. Some instantiations of the proposed estimator recover existing $k$-nearest neighbor based estimators of Shannon and Rényi entropies and Kullback–Leibler and Rényi divergences, and discover new consistent estimators for many other functionals such as logarithmic entropies and divergences. The $L_2$-consistency of the proposed estimator is established for a broad class of densities for general functionals, and the convergence rate in mean squared error is established as a function of the sample size for smooth, bounded densities.},

These algorithms combine the reduction technique of Orabona and P{\'a}l (2016) for adapting coin betting algorithms for online linear optimization with universal compression techniques in information theory for incorporating sequential side information to coin betting.
Concrete examples are studied in which the side information has a tree structure and consists of quantized values of the previous symbols of the adversarial sequence, including fixed-order and variable-order Markov cases.
By modifying the context-tree weighting technique of Willems, Shtarkov, and Tjalkens (1995), the proposed algorithm is further refined to achieve the best performance over all adaptive algorithms with tree-structured side information of a given maximum order in a computationally efficient manner.},

The recurrent structure of FRAE is designed to efficiently extract the redundancy along the time dimension and allows a compact discrete representation of the data to be learned. We demonstrate its effectiveness in speech spectrogram compression. Specifically, we show that the FRAE, paired with a powerful neural vocoder, can produce high-quality speech waveforms at a low, fixed bitrate. We further show that by adding a learned prior for the latent space and using an entropy coder, we can achieve an even lower variable bitrate.},

This paper shows that the distributed algorithm with $k=1$ over a sufficiently large number of groups attains a minimax optimal error rate up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor under some regularity conditions, for both regression and classification problems.
Roughly speaking, distributed 1-nearest-neighbor rules with $M$ groups has a performance comparable to standard $\Theta(M)$-nearest-neighbor rules.
In the analysis, alternative rules with a refined aggregation method are proposed and shown to attain exact minimax optimal rates.},

Building upon the gambling approach pioneered by Hendriks (2018) and Jun and Orabona (2019) and following the recent work of Waudby-Smith and Ramdas (2020) and Orabona and Jun (2021),
this paper revisits the idea of Cover (1991)'s universal portfolio in constructing confidence sequences and demonstrates new properties, based on a natural \emph{two-horse race} perspective on the gambling approach.
The main result of this paper is a new algorithm based on a mixture of lower bounds, which closely approximates the performance of Cover's universal portfolio with only constant per-round time complexity.
A higher-order generalization of a lower bound in (Fan et al, 2015), which is invoked in the proposed algorithm, may be of independent interest.},

The proposed model, dubbed as the variational Wyner model, is designed based on two classical problems in network information theory---distributed simulation and channel synthesis---in which Wyner's common information arises as the fundamental limit on the succinctness of the common representation.
The model is trained by minimizing the symmetric Kullback--Leibler divergence between variational and model distributions with regularization terms for common information, reconstruction consistency, and latent space matching terms, which is carried out via an adversarial density ratio estimation technique.
The utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments for joint and conditional generation with synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as a challenging zero-shot image retrieval task.},

  abstract={Learning a fair predictive model is crucial to mitigate biased decisions against minority groups in high-stakes applications. A common approach to learn such a model involves solving an optimization problem that maximizes the predictive power of the model under an appropriate group fairness constraint. However, in practice, sensitive attributes are often missing or noisy resulting in uncertainty. We demonstrate that solely enforcing fairness constraints on uncertain sensitive attributes can fall significantly short in achieving the level of fairness of models trained without uncertainty. To overcome this limitation, we propose a bootstrap-based algorithm that achieves the target level of fairness despite the uncertainty in sensitive attributes. The algorithm is guided by a Gaussian analysis for the independence notion of fairness where we propose a robust quadratically constrained quadratic problem to ensure a strict fairness guarantee with uncertain sensitive attributes. Our algorithm is applicable to both discrete and continuous sensitive attributes and is effective in real-world classification and regression tasks for various group fairness notions, e.g., independence and separation.},

  abstract = {Top-$L$ eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of a given linear operator, or finding its top-$L$ eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, is a fundamental task in many machine learning and scientific simulation problems.
For high-dimensional eigenvalue problems, training neural networks to parameterize the eigenfunctions is considered as a promising alternative to the classical numerical linear algebra techniques.
While several optimization frameworks have been proposed in this parametric approach, all the existing proposals either use an ad-hoc regularization to obtain orthogonal eigenfunctions and/or inherently suffer with biased gradient estimates.
In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework based on the low-rank approximation characterization of a truncated singular value decomposition (SVD), accompanied with a technique called \emph{nesting} for correctly learning the top-$L$ singular- value and functions up to degeneracy.
Top-$L$ EVD can be performed as a special case.
The proposed optimization framework is easy to implement with off-the-shelf gradient-based optimization algorithms,
since (1) it is based on an unconstrained optimization problem that naturally admits an unbiased gradient estimator,
and (2) it works without any extra orthonormalization steps and regularization terms.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework for various use-cases in machine learning and computational physics.},
