	abstract = {Using real walking to control the playback of the 360° videos is a natural and immersive way to match visual and self-motion perception. Redirected walking can enable users to walk in limited physical tracking space but experience larger scenes. Environment size may affect user perception in 360° videos. We conducted a user study about the detection thresholds (DTs) for translation and rotation gains in 360° video-based virtual environments in three scenes with different widths. Results show that environment size of the scene increases the DTs for both lower and upper translation gains but doesn't affect the DTs for rotation gains.},

	abstract = {History learning can help learners understand changes and establish identity. 360° videos can display complex history scenes, but limited to the visual and auditory. Passive haptic can provide tactile feedback by matching physical props to virtual counterparts. Utilizing passive haptic in 360° videos can create a diverse and rich experience but face matching problems because of perspective distortion. We propose using high-fidelity models and mapping videos to a cube space to solve this problem. The results of a 28 participants user study show that combining passive haptic with 360° videos enhances users' presence in historical experience.},

	abstract = {At present, there is little research on redirected walking in the direction of the slope. In this study, people were allowed to walk uphill or downhill in virtual environments by changing the slope of users' shoes, while they walked on a flat wooden board in physical environments. We can explore the impact of the shoe slope on users' perception of walking uphill or downhill in the virtual world. We find that the slope of the shoes affects participants' perception, increasing their sense of realism when walking uphill and downhill in the virtual world. With increasing or decreasing the shoe slope, participants' perception of the possibility of walking uphill or downhill will also change and establish corresponding detection thresholds.},
