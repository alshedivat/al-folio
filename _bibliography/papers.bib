  title={A New Dataset to Study a Century of Innovation in Europe and in the US},
  author={Bergeaud, Antonin and Verluise, Cyril},
  abstract={Innovation is an important driver of potential growth but quantitative evidence on the dynamics of innovative activities in the long-run are hardly documented due to the lack of data, especially in Europe. In this paper, we introduce PatentCity, a novel dataset on the location and nature of patentees from the 19th century using information derived from an automated extraction of relevant information from patent documents published by the German, French, British and US Intellectual Property offices. This dataset has been constructed with the view of facilitating the exploration of the geography of innovation and includes additional information on citizenship and occupation of inventors.},

  title={The Rise of China's Technological Power: the Perspective from Frontier Technologies},
  author={Verluise, Cyril and Bergeaud, Antonin},
  abstract={We develop a new method to identify patent in specific technologies and use it to study the contribution of the US, Europe, China, and Japan to frontier innovation. We find that China’s contribution to frontier technology has become quantitatively similar to the US in the late 2010s while overcoming the European and Japanese contributions. Although China still exhibits stigmas of a catching up economy, these stigmas are on the downside. The quality of frontier innovation published at the Chinese Patent Office has leveled up to the quality of patents published at the European and Japanese patent offices.},

  title={The Missing 15 Percent of Patent Citations},
  author={Verluise, Cyril and Cristelli, Gabriele and Higham, Kyle and de Rassenfosse, Gaétan},
  abstract={Patent citations are one of the most commonly-used metrics in the innovation literature. Leading uses of patent-to-patent citations are associated with the quantification of inventions’ quality and the measurement of knowledge flows. Due to their widespread availability, scholars have exploited citations listed on the front-page of patent documents. Citations appearing in the full-text of patent documents have been neglected. We apply modern machine learning methods to extract these citations from the text of USPTO patent documents. Overall, we are able to recover an additional 15 percent of patent citations that could not be found using only front-page data. We show that 'in-text' citations bring a different type of information compared to front-page citations. They exhibit higher text-similarity to the citing patents and alter the ranking of patent importance.},

  author={Broyer, Sylvain and Schneider, Emmanuel and Verluise, Cyril},
  abstract={Cash holdings of G7 corporates have hit new historical highs since the financial crisis. A common idea is that the precautionary motive would be the main factor: the accumulation of cash would result from lack of access to bank financing that corporates underwent during the financial crisis. We take an in-depth look at the development in cash holdings by corporates in the G7 and carry out an econometric test to identify whether the financial crisis has brought a regime switch. Our results indicate that cash holdings due to caution have increased only in those G7 countries where the disintermediation of external funding has also increased (USA, UK, Japan). In continental Europe, our tests invalidate the hypothesis of a regime switch in cash holdings.‪},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
