  abstract    = {We propose the use of data transformations as a defense against evasion attacks on ML classifiers. We present and investigate strategies for incorporating a variety of data transformations including dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis and data "anti-whitening" to enhance the resilience of machine learning, targeting both the classification and the training phase. We empirically evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of linear transformations of data as a defense mechanism against evasion attacks using multiple real-world datasets. Our key findings are that the defense is (i) effective against the best known evasion attacks from the literature, resulting in a two-fold increase in the resources required by a white-box adversary with knowledge of the defense for a successful attack, (ii) applicable across a range of ML classifiers, including Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks, and (iii) generalizable to multiple application domains, including image classification and human activity classification.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning models are known to be susceptible to adversarial perturbation. One famous attack is the adversarial patch, a sticker with a particularly crafted pattern that makes the model incorrectly predict the object it is placed on. This attack presents a critical threat to cyber-physical systems that rely on cameras such as autonomous cars. Despite the significance of the problem, conducting research in this setting has been difficult; evaluating attacks and defenses in the real world is exceptionally costly while synthetic data are unrealistic. In this work, we propose the REAP (REalistic Adversarial Patch) Benchmark, a digital benchmark that allows the user to evaluate patch attacks on real images, and under real-world conditions. Built on top of the Mapillary Vistas dataset, our benchmark contains over 14,000 traffic signs. Each sign is augmented with a pair of geometric and lighting transformations, which can be used to apply a digitally generated patch realistically onto the sign, while matching real-world conditions. Using our benchmark, we perform the first large-scale assessments of adversarial patch attacks under realistic conditions. Our experiments suggest that adversarial patch attacks may present a smaller threat than previously believed and that the success rate of an attack on simpler digital simulations is not predictive of its actual effectiveness in practice.},

  abstract      = {As an initial assessment, over 480,000 labeled virtual images of normal highway driving were readily generated in Grand Theft Auto V's virtual environment. Using these images, a CNN was trained to detect following distance to cars/objects ahead, lane markings, and driving angle (angular heading relative to lane centerline): all variables necessary for basic autonomous driving. Encouraging results were obtained when tested on over 50,000 labeled virtual images from substantially different GTA-V driving environments. This initial assessment begins to define both the range and scope of the labeled images needed for training as well as the range and scope of labeled images needed for testing the definition of boundaries and limitations of trained networks. It is the efficacy and flexibility of a "GTA-V"-like virtual environment that is expected to provide an efficient well-defined foundation for the training and testing of Convolutional Neural Networks for safe driving. Additionally, described is the Princeton Virtual Environment (PVE) for the training, testing and enhancement of safe driving AI, which is being developed using the video-game engine Unity. PVE is being developed to recreate rare but critical corner cases that can be used in re-training and enhancing machine learning models and understanding the limitations of current self driving models.

  abstract    = {When deploying machine learning models in real-world applications, an open-world learning framework is needed to deal with both normal in-distribution inputs and undesired out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Open-world learning frameworks include OOD detectors that aim to discard input examples which are not from the same distribution as the training data of machine learning classifiers. However, our understanding of current OOD detectors is limited to the setting of benign OOD data, and an open question is whether they are robust in the presence of adversaries. In this paper, we present the first analysis of the robustness of open-world learning frameworks in the presence of adversaries by introducing and designing \o odAdvExamples. Our experimental results show that current OOD detectors can be easily evaded by slightly perturbing benign OOD inputs, revealing a severe limitation of current open-world learning frameworks. Furthermore, we find that \o odAdvExamples also pose a strong threat to adversarial training based defense methods in spite of their effectiveness against in-distribution adversarial attacks. To counteract these threats and ensure the trustworthy detection of OOD inputs, we outline a preliminary design for a robust open-world machine learning framework.},

Any misclassification of traffic signs can potentially lead to a multitude of disastrous consequences, ranging from a life-threatening accident to even a large-scale interruption of transportation services relying on autonomous cars. In this paper, we propose and examine security attacks against sign recognition systems for Deceiving Autonomous caRs with Toxic Signs (we call the proposed attacks DARTS). In particular, we introduce two novel methods to create these toxic signs. First, we propose Out-of-Distribution attacks, which expand the scope of adversarial examples by enabling the adversary to generate these starting from an arbitrary point in the image space compared to prior attacks which are restricted to existing training/test data (In-Distribution). Second, we present the Lenticular Printing attack, which relies on an optical phenomenon to deceive the traffic sign recognition system. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks in both virtual and real-world settings and consider both white-box and black-box threat models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed attacks are successful under both settings and threat models. We further show that Out-of-Distribution attacks can outperform In-Distribution attacks on classifiers defended using the adversarial training defense, exposing a new attack vector for these defenses.},

Our scheme surpasses state-of-the-art defenses on MNIST and CIFAR-10 against l2-perturbation by a significant margin. With our models, the mean perturbation norm required to fool our MNIST model is 3.07 and 2.30 on CIFAR-10. Additionally, we propose a simple certifiable lower bound on the l2-norm of the adversarial perturbation using a more specific version of our scheme, a 1-NN on representations learned by a Lipschitz network. Our model provides a nontrivial average lower bound of the perturbation norm, comparable to other schemes on MNIST with similar clean accuracy.},

  abstract    = {Neural networks' lack of robustness against attacks raises concerns in security-sensitive settings 
                 such as autonomous vehicles. While many countermeasures may look promising, only a few withstand rigorous evaluation. 
                 Defenses using random transformations (RT) have shown impressive results, particularly BaRT (Raff et al., 2019) on ImageNet. 
                 However, this type of defense has not been rigorously evaluated, leaving its robustness properties poorly understood. 
                 Their stochastic properties make evaluation more challenging and render many proposed attacks on deterministic models inapplicable. 
                 First, we show that the BPDA attack (Athalye et al., 2018a) used in BaRT’s evaluation is ineffective and likely over-estimates its robustness. 
                 We then attempt to construct the strongest possible RT defense through the informed selection of transformations and 
                 Bayesian optimization for tuning their parameters. Furthermore, we create the strongest possible attack to evaluate our RT defense. 
                 Our new attack vastly outperforms the baseline, reducing the accuracy by 83% compared to the 19% reduction by the commonly 
                 used EoT attack (4.3x improvement). Our result indicates that the RT defense on Imagenette dataset (ten-class subset of ImageNet) 
                 is not robust against adversarial examples. Extending the study further, we use our new attack to adversarially train RT defense

Dual-domain training, optimizing on both clean and adversarial objectives, can help realize a better trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness. In this paper, we develop methods to improve dual-domain training for large adversarial perturbations and complex datasets. We first demonstrate that existing methods suffer from poor performance in this setting, due to a poor training procedure and overfitting to a particular attack. Then, we develop novel methods to address these issues. First, we show that adding KLD regularization to the dual training objective mitigates this overfitting and achieves a better trade-off, on CIFAR-10 and a 10-class subset of ImageNet. Then, inspired by domain adaptation, we develop a new normalization technique, Dual Batch Normalization, to further improve accuracy. Combining these two strategies, our model sets a new state of the art in trade-off performance for dual-domain adversarial training.},

For the most part, these attacks have been applied directly to isolated neural network models. However, in practice, machine learning models are just a component of a much larger system, and we find that state-of-the-art query-based attacks are as much as four times less effective at attacking a prediction pipeline with only one preprocessor than attacking the machine learning model alone. We can explain this discrepancy by the fact that most preprocessors introduce some notion of ``invariant'' to the input space (e.g., with center crop, the prediction is invariant to the border pixels). Hence, attacks that are unaware of this invariance inevitably wastes a large number of queries to re-discover or to overcome it. We therefore develop techniques to first reverse-engineer preprocessors and then use the extracted information to attack the end-to-end system. Our extraction method uses only a few hundreds queries to learn the preprocessors used by most publicly available models, and our preprocessor-aware attack recovers the same efficacy as just attacking the model alone.},

We propose a heuristic attack that allows us to use gradient descent to find adversarial examples for kNN classifiers, and then apply it to attack the DkNN defense as well. Results suggest that our attack is moderately stronger than any naive attack on kNN and significantly outperforms other attacks on DkNN.},

  abstract      = {We propose a new real-world attack against the computer vision based systems of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Our novel Sign Embedding attack exploits the concept of adversarial examples to modify innocuous signs and advertisements in the environment such that they are classified as the adversary's desired traffic sign with high confidence. Our attack greatly expands the scope of the threat posed to AVs since adversaries are no longer restricted to just modifying existing traffic signs as in previous work. Our attack pipeline generates adversarial samples which are robust to the environmental conditions and noisy image transformations present in the physical world. We ensure this by including a variety of possible image transformations in the optimization problem used to generate adversarial samples. We verify the robustness of the adversarial samples by printing them out and carrying out drive-by tests simulating the conditions under which image capture would occur in a real-world scenario. We experimented with physical attack samples for different distances, lighting conditions and camera angles. In addition, extensive evaluations were carried out in the virtual setting for a variety of image transformations. The adversarial samples generated using our method have adversarial success rates in excess of 95\% in the physical as well as virtual settings.},

  abstract    = {Adversarial training (AT) has become a popular choice for training robust networks.
                 However, it tends to sacrifice clean accuracy heavily in favor of robustness and suffers
                 from a large generalization error. To address these concerns, we propose Smooth Adversarial
                 Training (SAT), guided by our analysis on the eigenspectrum of the loss Hessian. We
                 find that curriculum learning, a scheme that emphasizes on starting "easy'' and gradually
                 ramping up on the "difficulty'' of training, smooths the adversarial loss landscape
                 for a suitably chosen difficulty metric. We present a general formulation for curriculum
                 learning in the adversarial setting and propose two difficulty metrics based on the
                 maximal Hessian eigenvalue (H-SAT) and the softmax probability (P-SA). We demonstrate
                 that SAT stabilizes network training even for a large perturbation norm and allows
                 the network to operate at a better clean accuracy versus robustness trade-off curve
                 compared to AT. This leads to a significant improvement in both clean accuracy and
                 robustness compared to AT, TRADES, and other baselines. To highlight a few results,
                 our best model improves normal and robust accuracy by 6% and 1% on CIFAR-100 compared
                 to AT, respectively. On Imagenette, a ten-class subset of ImageNet, our model outperforms
                 AT by 23% and 3% on normal and robust accuracy respectively.},

  abstract    = {The adversarial training paradigm has become the standard in training deep neural networks for robustness. Yet, it remains unstable, with the mechanisms driving this instability poorly understood. In this study, we discover that this instability is primarily driven by a non-smooth optimization landscape and an internal covariate shift phenomenon, and show that Batch Normalization (BN) can effectively mitigate both these issues. Further, we demonstrate that BN universally improves clean and robust performance across various defenses, datasets, and model types, with greater improvement on more difficult tasks. Finally, we confirm BN's heterogeneous distribution issue with mixed-batch training and propose a solution.},
