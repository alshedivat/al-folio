  abstract={Event-based neuromorphic systems provide a low-power solution by using artificial neurons and synapses to process data asynchronously in the form of spikes. Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions (FTJs) are ultra low-power memory devices and are well-suited to be integrated in these systems. Here, we present a hybrid FTJ-CMOS Integrate-and-Fire neuron which constitutes a fundamental building block for new-generation neuromorphic networks for edge computing. We demonstrate electrically tunable neural dynamics achievable by tuning the switching of the FTJ device.},

  abstract={The ability to detect correlated events in the environment is an important feat of biological neural networks. Neuromorphic computing strives to mimic this ability for efficient sensory processing. For this purpose, we propose a HfO2-based ferroelectric capacitor (FeCap)-complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron able to detect highly correlated events exploiting two different temporal dynamics. The possibility to exploit two time constants increases the versatility of the neuron and its dynamic adaptation while offering a compact and elegant solution for detection of both transient and sustained coincidences. Moreover, the time constants are in biologically relevant time scales, which makes the neuron suitable to solve real-time tasks such as keyword spotting or sensory processing. The proposed FeCap-based LIF (FeLIF) neuron enriches the dynamic of a standard LIF neuron fostering the development of advanced event-based analog neuromorphic hardware.},
