  abstract={Recently, machine learning models have demonstrated to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, primarily due to the lack of transparency in black-box models such as deep neural networks. A third-party model can be poisoned such that it works adequately in normal conditions but behaves maliciously on samples with specific trigger patterns. However, the trigger injection function is manually defined in most existing backdoor attack methods, e.g., placing a small patch of pixels on an image or slightly deforming the image before poisoning the model. This results in a two-stage approach with a sub-optimal attack success rate and a lack of complete stealthiness under human inspection.

  In this paper, we propose a novel and stealthy backdoor attack framework, LIRA, which jointly learns the optimal, stealthy trigger injection function and poisons the model. We formulate such an objective as a non-convex, constrained optimization problem. Under this optimization framework, the trigger generator function will learn to manipulate the input with imperceptible noise to preserve the model performance on the clean data and maximize the attack success rate on the poisoned data. Then, we solve this challenging optimization problem with an efficient, two-stage stochastic optimization procedure. Finally, the proposed attack framework achieves 100% success rates in several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and T-ImageNet, while simultaneously bypassing existing backdoor defense methods and human inspection.

  abstract = {Computing graph similarity is an important task in many graph-related applications
  such as retrieval in graph databases or graph clustering. While numerous measures
  have been proposed to capture the similarity between a pair of graphs, Graph Edit
  Distance (GED) and Maximum Common Subgraphs (MCS) are the two widely used measures
  in practice. GED and MCS are domain-agnostic measures of structural similarity between
  the graphs and define the similarity as a function of pairwise alignment of different
  entities (such as nodes, edges, and subgraphs) in the two graphs. The explicit explainability
  offered by the pairwise alignment provides transparency and justification of the similarity
  score, thus, GED and MCS have important practical applications. However, their exact
  computations are known to be NP-hard. While recently proposed neural-network based
  approximations have been shown to accurately compute these similarity scores, they
  have limited ability in providing comprehensive explanations compared to classical
  combinatorial algorithms, e.g., Beam search. This paper aims at efficiently approximating
  these domain-agnostic similarity measures through a neural network, and simultaneously
  learning the alignments (i.e., explanations) similar to those of classical intractable
  methods. Specifically, we formulate the similarity between a pair of graphs as the
  minimal "transformation" cost from one graph to another in the learnable node-embedding
  space. We show that, if node embedding is able to capture its neighborhood context
  closely, our proposed similarity function closely approximates both the alignment
  and the similarity score of classical methods. Furthermore, we also propose an efficient
  differentiable computation of our proposed objective for model training. Empirically,
  we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 50%-100% reduction in the Mean
  Squared Error for the graph similarity approximation task and up to 20% improvement
  in the retrieval evaluation metrics for the graph retrieval task. The source code
  is available at https://github.com/khoadoan/GraphOTSim.},

  abstract = {Searching for documents with semantically similar content is a fundamental problem
  in the information retrieval domain with various challenges, primarily, in terms of
  efficiency and effectiveness. Despite the promise of modeling structured dependencies
  in documents, several existing text hashing methods lack an efficient mechanism to
  incorporate such vital information. Additionally, the desired characteristics of an
  ideal hash function, such as robustness to noise, low quantization error and bit balance/uncorrelation,
  are not effectively learned with existing methods. This is because of the requirement
  to either tune additional hyper-parameters or optimize these heuristically and explicitly
  constructed cost functions. In this paper, we propose a Denoising Adversarial Binary
  Autoencoder (DABA) model which presents a novel representation learning framework
  that captures structured representation of text documents in the learned hash function.
  Also, adversarial training provides an alternative direction to implicitly learn a
  hash function that captures all the desired characteristics of an ideal hash function.
  Essentially, DABA adopts a novel single-optimization adversarial training procedure
  that minimizes the Wasserstein distance in its primal domain to regularize the encoder’s
  output of either a recurrent neural network or a convolutional autoencoder. We empirically
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in capturing the intrinsic semantic
  manifold of the related documents. The proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
  shallow and deep unsupervised hashing methods for the document retrieval task on several
  prominent document collections.},

  abstract = {Digital advertising is performed in multiple ways, for e.g., contextual, display-based
  and search-based advertising. Across these avenues, the primary goal of the advertiser
  is to maximize the return on investment. To realize this, the advertiser often aims
  to target the advertisements towards a targeted set of audience as this set has a
  high likelihood to respond positively towards the advertisements. One such form of
  tailored and personalized, targeted advertising is known as look-alike modeling, where
  the advertiser provides a set of seed users and expects the machine learning model
  to identify a new set of users such that the newly identified set is similar to the
  seed-set with respect to the online purchasing activity. Existing look-alike modeling
  techniques (i.e., similarity-based and regression-based) suffer from serious limitations
  due to the implicit constraints induced during modeling. In addition, the high-dimensional
  and sparse nature of the advertising data increases the complexity. To overcome these
  limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel Adversarial Factorization Autoencoder
  that can efficiently learn a binary mapping from sparse, high-dimensional data to
  a binary address space through the use of an adversarial training procedure. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our proposed approach on a dataset obtained from a real-world
  setting and also systematically compare the performance of our proposed approach with
  existing look-alike modeling baselines.},
