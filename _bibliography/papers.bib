  abstract={The weak equivalence principle (WEP) in the quantum regime has been the subject of many studies with a broad range of approaches to the problem. Here, we tackle the problem anew through the time of arrival (TOA) operator approach. This is done by constructing the TOA operator for a nonrelativistic and structureless particle that is projected upward in a uniform gravitational field with an intended arrival point below the classical turning point. The TOA operator is constructed under the constraint that the inertial and gravitational masses are equivalent and that Galilean invariance is preserved. These constraints are implemented by Weyl quantization of the corresponding classical TOA function for the projectile. The expectation value of the TOA operator is explicitly shown to be equal to the classical time of arrival plus mass-dependent quantum correction terms, implying incompatibility of the WEP with quantum mechanics. The full extent of the violation of the WEP is shown through the mass dependence of TOA distribution for the projectile.},

  abstract={We demonstrate that the quantum corrections to the classical arrival time for a quantum object in a potential free region of space, as computed in Phys. Rev. A 80, 030102(R) (2009), can be eliminated up to a given order of ℏ by choosing an appropriate position-dependent phase for the object's wave function. This then implies that we can make the quantum arrival time of the object as close as possible to its corresponding classical arrival time, allowing us to synchronize a classical and quantum clock, which tells time using the classical and quantum arrival time of the object, respectively. We provide an example for synchronizing such a clock by making use of a quantum object with a position-dependent phase imprinted on the object's initial wave function with the use of an impulsive potential.},
