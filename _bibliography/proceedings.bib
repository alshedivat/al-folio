  abstract={In classical physics, the weak equivalence principle (WEP) states that bodies fall with the same acceleration regardless of their composition and mass. On the contrary, studies on the quantum image of a particle undergoing free-fall has shown a violation of the WEP. Here, we show that these violation is manifested through quantum corrections to the classical time of arrival (TOA). We start by constructing a TOA operator by quantizing the classical TOA function using Born-Jordan ordering rule. The expectation value of the TOA operator is then calculated and expressed as an asymptotic expansion of ℏ. The leading term of the expansion is shown to be equal to the classical TOA while the rest are quantum correction terms. However, these quantum corrections vanish in the large momentum limit thereby recovering the WEP. We trace this quantum violation of the WEP to fact that there is no velocity operator in quantum mechanics.}

  abstract={The weak equivalence principle for quantum systems states that particles with the same velocity wavefunction behave identically in free fall implying that the TOA distribution of different particles should be identical regardless of mass as long as they have the same initial momentum. This leads us to study the distribution of the first time of arrival for spinless particles fired upward using the theory of quantum time of arrival operators. We start by constructing an appropriate time of arrival operator that is conjugate with the system Hamiltonian using Weyl quantization. The time of arrival distribution was then constructed and shown to be mass-dependent, implying violation of the weak equivalence principle.}

  abstract={An expression for the transition amplitude of the energy translation generated by the confined time of arrival (CTOA) operators on the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions was obtained using resolvent functional calculus. It is then showed numerically that the CTOA operators are not generators of energy translation.}

  abstract={Quantum corrections to the classical time of arrival arises if time is treated quantum mechanically, i.e. time is a dynamical observable. Here, we demonstrate how to eliminate these quantum corrections for a quantum object in a potential free region of space, as computed in Phys. Rev. A 80, 030102(R) (2009), can be eliminated up to ħ2 using an appropriate position dependent phase. By doing so, we are able to synchronize classical and quantum clocks that tells time using the classical and quantum arrival time of the object, respectively. We provide an example for synchronizing such a clock.}
