  abstract = {The EURO meets NeurIPS 2022 Vehicle Routing Competition (see https://euro-neurips-vrp-2022.challenges.ortec.com/) focuses on the usual static Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), as well as a dynamic variant which is the focus of this paper. The objective of the dynamic VRPTW is to build routes for a fleet of capacitated vehicles, in order to serve all customer requests within their given time windows. The objective is to minimize the total travel time. However, requests are not known in advance: they arrive continuously during the day. Every hour, the decision maker chooses which requests to dispatch and builds routes to serve them. Each request must be served before the end of its time window. A request whose time window allows serving it during the next hour can be postponed. Once a route has been built, it cannot be modified. The static VRPTW has been extensively studied in the literature, including exact approaches, as well as heuristic ones. This can be seen in the results of the challenge: the objective of the algorithm proposed by the 5th team on the static problem is 0.04% worse than the best solution found. The question of building an efficient heuristic for the dynamic problem remains far more open: the policy proposed by the 5th team is 4% worse than the best proposed. Our main contribution is a policy for the dynamic VRPTW. It relies on a Deep Learning pipeline with a prize collecting VRPTW combinatorial optimization layer. It ranked first of the competition. This pipeline requires a subroutine for solving the prize collecting VRPTW, for which we introduce the prize collecting hybrid genetic search, a variant of the hybrid genetic search adapted for the prize collecting VRPTW. As a side contribution, we implemented an extension of the InferOpt.jl Julia library with a generic support for generalized combinatorial optimization oracles, and in particular for training our pipeline.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. Vehicle routing and vehicle scheduling problems are extensively studied in the literature, and extremely efficient algorithms are now available to tackle them. Both exact and heuristic approaches exist to solve these pure vehicle routing and scheduling problems. For example, the Vehicle Scheduling Problem (VSP) can be exactly solved by a flow linear program, and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) can be exactly solved using Branch-and-Price, or heuristically on larger instances using the state-of-the-art Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS). However, algorithms for variations of these pure problems are often not as efficient, and have difficulty to scale on large instances. An example of this setting is the Stochastic Vehicle Scheduling Problem (StoVSP), a variation of the VSP where travel and task times are randomly perturbed after the vehicle routes are chosen, the objective beeing to minimize the average total delay of the tasks. StoVSP can be solved with column generation on instances with up to 25 tasks, but then fails to scale and generalize to larger instance sizes. Another example is the Dynamic Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (Dynamic-CVRPTW), a multi-stage variation of the CVRP, for which the HGS does not apply anymore. Using pure vehicle routing and scheduling problem algorithms as Combinatorial Optimization (CO) layers in Machine Learning (ML) pipelines can be a way to generate good algorithms for their variations. We present such hybrid pipelines for the two variations presented above, implemented by leveraging InferOpt.jl, our open source Julia package gathering several state-of-the-art methods for integrating CO algorithms in ML pipelines. For the StoVSP, we learn a pipeline containing a VSP flow algorithm, and are able to generalize and obtain solutions with small gaps on instances with up to 1000 tasks. For the Dynamic-CVRPTW, we learn a pipeline containing a modified HGS as a CO layer, and use it at each stage to retrieve a good policy.},

Ce stage s'inscrit dans le cadre d'un projet avec Transilien, qui a pour but de fournir un outil d'aide à la décision qui propose des scénarios de replanification lors des perturbations sur le réseau. L'objectif de mon stage était de s'intéresser à l'utilisation des données d'historiques à disposition afin d'expérimenter des méthodes hybrides entre apprentissage et recherche opérationnelle, afin de déterminer si cela peut aider à l'amélioration des algorithmes d'optimisation de l'outil. Nous avons expérimenté des modèles de Graph Neural Networks utilisant les données d'historiques de plans de transport, afin de guider les heuristiques d'optimisation.},
