The **depositar lab** researches and develops systems and tools for novel research data infrastructures and services. We operate the _[depositar](https://data.depositar.io/)_, a public repository for research data, and curate the _[Research Data Management Hub (RDM Hub)](https://rdm.depositar.io/)_ for researchers of all disciplines in Taiwan and worldwide. We also work with our partners on large-scale digital preservation and data collaboration projects. We use and make open source software. The services we provide are free to all to use.

Our works are supported by Taiwan's [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) (the Institute of Information Science and the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation), the [National Science and Technology Council](https://www.nstc.gov.tw/?l=en) (the Department of Natural Sciences and Sustainable Development), and grants from other sources.

We are based [at a hillside in Nangang, Taipei](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/127949217/). Our partners, past and present, include the Center for GIS of Academia Sinica, National Museum of Taiwan History, Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF), Taiwan Biodiversity Research Institute, Taiwan Long-Term Social-Ecological Research Network (LTSER Taiwan), Word Gleaners Ltd., Nature Watch Ecological and Environmental Consultancy Ltd., among others.
