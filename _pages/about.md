Established in 1973 by [Tom DeFanti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_A._DeFanti) and [Dan Sandin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Sandin), the [Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Visualization_Laboratory) is a pioneering interdisciplinary research laboratory in the Computer Science department at the [University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_Chicago) College of Engineering. Initially named the Circle Graphics Habitat, reflecting UIC's original designation, the laboratory has continuously specialized in collaborative visualization, [virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality), visual data science, and advanced computing and networking infrastructure. EVL is known for consistently looking 10-15 years into the future and has built a significant legacy of innovation. 

In the 1970s, the lab pioneered real-time interactive graphics and videogame technology, developing groundbreaking tools such as the [GRASS programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASS_(programming_language)) and the Sandin Image Processor, which facilitated real-time video and animation. Notably, EVL technology contributed to iconic film imagery, including [Larry Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Cuba)’s wireframe animation of the Death Star for the original ["Star Wars"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(film)) film.

In the 1980s, EVL shifted focus to scientific visualization and introduced innovations such as the Sayre Glove—one of the earliest [data gloves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_glove) for virtual interaction—and PHSColograms, autostereoscopic holograms enabling 3D visualization without special glasses.

Throughout the 1990s, EVL became internationally renowned for its advances in virtual reality and high-speed networking infrastructure. Key developments included the invention of the influential [CAVE™ virtual-reality environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_automatic_virtual_environment), the ImmersaDesk™, the Infinity Wall, and significant contributions to grid computing initiatives like I-WAY. EVL also spearheaded critical networking initiatives such as STAR TAP and [StarLight](https://www.startap.net/starlight/), connecting international scientific communities with high-speed networking.

During the 2000s, EVL further expanded its innovations, developing technologies to access, share, and display ultra-high-resolution imagery on tiled display walls, including the OptIPortal and the [SAGE™ (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment)](https://www.sagecommons.org/). More recent advancements from the 2010s onward include the CAVE2™ hybrid-reality environment and collaborative visualization systems such as SAGE2™ and SAGE3™ (Scalable Amplified Group Environments).

From early collaborations with artists to today's global partnerships with scientists and engineers in academia, government, and industry, EVL has nurtured and expanded user communities, fostering interdisciplinary research and application. Its faculty, staff, and students consistently publish in prestigious journals and conferences worldwide.

EVL’s work continues to be supported by various organizations, including the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation), [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health), [Department of Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy), [Argonne National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonne_National_Laboratory), The Joseph and Bessie Feinberg Foundation, Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, [Procter & Gamble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procter_%26_Gamble), the State of Illinois, and UIC. EVL remains committed to its mission of advancing scientific discovery by creating cutting-edge visualization and virtual-reality tools, techniques, and infrastructure.
