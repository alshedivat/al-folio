Data Science Transition | Former Chef

With a decade of thriving in the culinary realm, I'm primed to translate my creative, 
managerial, and problem-solving prowess into the field of data science. My culinary 
journey cultivated a deep well of skills transferrable to data analytics, where 
innovation meets precision.

Equipped with a proven track record in leading teams, crafting intricate solutions, 
and mastering the art of details, I now embark on a dynamic shift toward data-driven 
excellence. My adaptability, communication finesse, and results-oriented mindset 
promise to enrich data projects with a fresh perspective. Let's connect to explore 
how my seasoned background can infuse a new dimension into your data endeavors.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
