I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in aeronautics and astronautics at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, where I'm also working toward the M.S. degree in mathematics.
My research interests includes game theory and variational analysis, data-driven control, and networked dynamical systems. I'm also interested in applying the developed techniques to analyze distributed systems operating in cooperative/noncooperative environments.

...more about me. I received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2014, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA, in 2017, both in the area of control theory. I'm a recipient of William E. Boeing Endowed Fellowship, Paul A. Carlstedt Endowment, and Latvian Arctic Pilot–A. Vagners Memorial Scholarship with UW in 2018 and 2019, and Frank Hubbard Engineering Scholarship with UCF in 2017.
