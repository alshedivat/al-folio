I am an incoming Ph.D. student in computer science at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), advised by [Hanspeter Pfister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanspeter_Pfister).
I am deeply interested in data visualization, biomedical imaging, and computer vision. I create novel interactive technologies that allow scientists to study domain specific problems visually.
My latest research focuses on applications of data visualization in neuroscience and climate sciences.
  

I hold an M.Sc. in visual computing and a B.Sc. in medical informatics from [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/). During my studies, I had some fantastic opportunities to conduct research abroad. For my master thesis research, I visited the [Visual Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. Before that, I was interning in Markus Hadwiger’s [High-Performance Visualization Group](http://vccvisualization.org/) at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) and [Brainlab](https://www.brainlab.com/), Munich.
I was born and raised in the beautiful town [Regensburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regensburg) in Germany. So you can talk to me in English or German.
