Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of collaborating with geologists, geophysicists, geomorphologists, glaciologists and other specialists; even though I am still none of them right nowü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I've experienced a fantastic journey from discovering [offshore oil](https://zhihaol.eu.org/projects/2020_q35/) to carbon capture and storage, from glacial mass balance to hydrological models, from [the origin of landforms](https://zhihaol.eu.org/blog/2022/Quaternary-geomorphology-of-Norway/) to offshore windfarm site derisking, and from predicting [permafrost changes in 2100](https://zhihaol.eu.org/blog/2022/permafrost-extent/) to climate model downscaling. [All things are nested by geophysical data science,](https://i.imgur.com/wldOmMO.png) under the framework of [**Bayes theorem**](https://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophy-of-science/Explanations-laws-and-theories), which is about how to make better decisions and predictions based on incomplete observations and prior knowledge of the Earth system.

Geodata holds the key to uncovering hidden treasures for energy, the environment and society...For example, can we know more about the variability of [snow mass distribution](https://zhihaol.eu.org/projects/2022_snowdepth/)? If we do so, the energy system will be more robust in hydropower production areas, such as Norway, Switzerland, and Southwest China. Similarly, [more precise and bias-free climate observations & models](https://zhihaol.eu.org/projects/2023_downscaling/) will help us better cope with the uncertainties associated with climate-related risks.
