I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at York University, Toronto, advised by [Dr. Niko Troje](https://www.biomotionlab.ca/niko-troje/). I am also a [VISTA](https://vista.info.yorku.ca/) and [CVR](http://www.cvr.yorku.ca/) trainee. My research interests are machine learning, computer vision, computer graphics, and computer animation. My current research focus is on leveraging novel deep probabilistic models for realistic human motion modelling.
