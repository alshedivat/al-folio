<b> ...a little about me</b> <br>
I was an [Engineering Scie](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/)[nce ](https://youtu.be/BcPO4yhWSUg) student major in Engineering Physics at the University of Toronto, Canada. I am primarily interested in computational physics, dynamical systems, numerical (spectral methods) approaches to fluid mechanics, and all the other fields in physics and mathematics. I shall start my graduate study in [Complex Adaptive Systems](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/Pages/Complex-Adaptive-Systems.aspx) at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden from September 2022.

I am working with [Prof. Nicolas Grisouard](https://sites.physics.utoronto.ca/nicolasgrisouard) from the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto. My current research project is on developing a [Fourier-Bessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier%E2%80%93Bessel_series) based spectral Laplacian solver in 2D polar coordinates for [Gross-Pitaevskii equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross%E2%80%93Pitaevskii_equation) which governs Bose–Einstein condensates. I am also working on discovering new types of discrete generalized Fourier methods using [Dini series](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiniExpansion.html) in polar coordinates with [Prof. Natalie Baddour](https://engineering.uottawa.ca/people/baddour-natalie) from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Ottawa. For more detailed introductions on my works, please click [here](/projects).

Out of academics, I am a wine and whisky enthusiast with the [WSET 3](https://www.wsetglobal.com/qualifications/wset-level-3-award-in-wines/) qualification. I also enjoy playing [DOTA2](https://www.dota2.com/home), I used to play competitively for team UofT at [CSL Esports](https://cslesports.com/#who) league.

...<b>a bit more on my name</b> <br>
In Chinese, last names are placed in the front, so my name actually goes as: 周 润东, with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin'>pīnyīn</a>: zhōu rùn/dōng. <br>And I always forgive people who don't speak Mandarin to pronounce it without the tones. :></font>
