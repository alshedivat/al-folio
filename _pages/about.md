Hello, you! I am a Ph. D. student at the [Informatic Center](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/){:target="\_blank"} of the [Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/){:target="\_blank"}
advised by [Fernando Castor](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor/){:target="\_blank"} and [Fernanda Madeiral](https://fermadeiral.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}. 
Also, I am a teacher at the [Federal Institute of Pernambuco](https://www.ifpe.edu.br/){:target="\_blank"} in the [Campus Palmares](https://www.palmares.ifpe.edu.br/){:target="\_blank"}. 
During 2021, I was in Stockholm/Sweden in an internship at [KTH - Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en){:target="\_blank"} supervised by [Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/){:target="\_blank"}.

I am interested in Software Engineering, more particularly in Software Quality. My current research aims to recommend code readability and legibility improvements for software developers. 
In that way, I am specifically interested in code reviews and mining software repositories.

I obtained my MSc degree in [Computer Science](http://computacao.ufcg.edu.br/){:target="\_blank"} at the [Federal University of Campina Grande](https://portal.ufcg.edu.br/){:target="\_blank"} (2015), 
advised by  [Hyggo Almeida](https://hyggo.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/){:target="\_blank"}. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the same university.


<!--- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

<!--- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

<!--- Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
