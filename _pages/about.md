I am a master's student at Xiamen University working on geometric reasoning for 3D vision, embodied intelligence, and AI-native content creation. My research goal is to build systems that understand the dynamic world from sparse observations and can assist humans with reliable spatial perception.

I recently co-developed projects such as VLM-3R, Large Spatial Model (NeurIPS 2024), DynamicVerse (NeurIPS 2025), and InstantSplat, where we combine large multimodal models with geometric priors to enable end-to-end semantic reconstruction, world modeling, and fast Gaussian splatting. These collaborations often involve partners from both academia and industry, and I actively maintain the associated open-source artifacts to keep our results reproducible.
