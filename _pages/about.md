<b>Primary interests:</b> Algorithms, Operations Research, AI, Mobility

My passion is to build a two-way bridge connecting research with practice. I firmly believe that the wide gap separating academic research from real-world problems (especially in computational fields) is far from optimal. Closing this gap faces immense intellectual and societal barriers. I work to realize the dream that lies on the other side of these barriers - challenges of common people fueling fundamental scientific progress; the breakthroughs, in turn, turning into technologies powering disruptions that ease societal pain.

My work spans theoretical research to develop algorithms and insights, applied research to develop technologies, and taking research out of the lab to build products.

<b>Bio:</b> Prior to founding my startup, I have been at Lyft Labs (high-risk, high reward radical bets in dispatch and matching tech and fleet optimization), Twitter (content relevance, advertisement targeting, user identity bridging and spatio-temporal user modeling) and IBM Research (biomedical information extraction and disambiguation for drug discovery).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Algorithms and Complexity group at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) and in the College of Computer Sciences at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/).

I received my PhD in Computer Science from [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.tifr.res.in/) and my undergraduate degree (B.Tech.) in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/).
