I'm an Assistant Professor and Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin fellow at the Institute for Computational Cosmology in Durham, UK. In my [main line of research](/projects/dm), I work at the interface of cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations and large 21&#8209;cm radio surveys to study the dark matter content and structure of galaxies. I also occasionally work on galaxy formation and evolution (especially of [satellites in groups and clusters](/projects/satellites)), weak gravitational lensing, and Galactic archaeology. I like to do a bit of [data visualisation](/projects/vis) when I can find the time, and try to make useful contributions to open-source code. I have a public tool for making mock 21&#8209;cm observations of simulated galaxies:
