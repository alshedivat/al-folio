I am a second year graduate student at University of British Columbia, Vancouver. I am originally from Bombay, India.   

My research interests include: Formal methods; End-to-end verification of systems; Programming languages; Cyber physical systems; Operating systems; Security.

I am currently a part of Dependable Systems Lab in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at UBC, Vancouver. I work with  Prof. [Karthik Pattabiraman](http://blogs.ubc.ca/karthik/).

For some personal but not too personal writings feel free to check out my [blog.](https://grep-aarkash.github.io/musings/)



<!-- I love playing guitar and swimming. It's been more than a decade since I picked up this instrument and since then I have never looked back. My most precious possession is my ['93 Japanese vintage stratocaster]({{ site.url }}assets/img/guitar.jpg). I keep putting short videos now and then. I recently started painting (Beware!). I read a lot, my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50819981-aarti-kashyap) profile tracks some of the works I read. -->
