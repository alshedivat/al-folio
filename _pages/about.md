Greetings! I am Nam Tran, a Research Fellow at the [School of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/mse), [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) (Singapore), supervised by [Prof. Li Shuzhou](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00773). I was awared a Ph.D. in Material Engineering at the [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/) (Australia) with an outstanding degree in 2022 advised by [A/Prof. Hongtao Zhu](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/hongtao-zhu). Prior to my Ph.D, I obtained both my M.Sc. (2011) and B.Sc. (2014) in Condensed Matter Physics from [University of Science - Vietnam National University](https://hus.vnu.edu.vn/). In 2014, I was among eight young Asian researchers awarded a scholarship from the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO) to undertake the Quantum Engineering Design Course (QEDC) at [Osaka University](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/) under the supervised of [Prof. Hideki Kasai](http://www.dyn.ap.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp/web/).

I have a deep passion for various aspects of theoretical and computational materials science, spanning from methodological advancements to practical applications. My current research is centered around the application of multiscale techniques and machine learning for realistic modeling of electrochemical systems, tribology systems, and high entropy alloys, with a wide range of applications. Please take a look at the “Projects” and “Publications” pages to learn more about my research and publications!
