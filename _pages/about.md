I am Dhawal, I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH](https://home.dartmouth.edu/dartmouth). I am working with Prof. [Adithya Pediredla](https://sites.google.com/view/adithyapediredla/) in developing Novel Imaging Systems. I completed my Masters student at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I spent a wonderful time working with Prof. [P.J. Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ) and some great folks at [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/).


Please find my [cv](/assets/pdf/dhawal1939_cv.pdf) for further details.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
