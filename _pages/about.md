NEW NEW NEW The DxD Lab is based out of [IDKAIST](https://id.kaist.ac.kr/). We explore design from, with and by data to develop technologies that are more sensitive to human concerns and behaviors.  
We also investigate the social impact of data and artificial intelligence. We work to provide novel conceptual and computational tools and methodologies for designing various human-centered AI applications from algorithmic fact-checking to a voice-based conversational agent for autistic adolescents.
