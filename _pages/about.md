Currently, I am a software engineer at Apple; and I have interests
in applied and computational mathematics, machine learning, and
statisics research and applications.

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in mathematics from Nanyang Technological
University (NTU) in 2022. In my [dissertation](https://hdl.handle.net/10356/163311),
I developed a reformulation of additive models and their fitting algorithms, which
fused the methods of reroughing, stacking, and additive models in the context of
multi-target regression.
- Notably, this formulated the non-constant initialization of gradient boosting,
which tied the pragmatic tweak of an offset to well-established methods in data
analysis, machine learning, and statistics.
- In the case that the offset were predictions from Google's quantum device calibration
model, then the formulation enhanced those predictions and decreased test error in a
numerical experiment.

Additionally, I am an original member of the 
[Mathematical Picture Language Project](https://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/)
at Harvard University, where I established the link between the mathematics
of planar algebras and the science of quantum information and computation.
- This led to a collaboration in which multiple charged string picture
languages were developed.
