ICCLab was founded in September 2022, when [Dr. Dinh Nguyen](https://vinuni.edu.vn/people/nguyen-van-dinh-phd/) joined the [College of Engineering Computer Science, VinUniversity](https://vinuni.edu.vn/college-of-engineering-computer-science/).

Our research interests are mainly on employing various applied mathematical tools (i.e., stochastic modeling, queueing theory and optimization theory) and machine learning techniques to design, analyze and optimize the cutting-edge applications in complexed wire/wireless networks: fog/edge computing and data center, IoT networks, 5G/6G network resource allocations, and distributed machine learning for wireless networks.
