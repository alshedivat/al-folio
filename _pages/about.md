I am a Ph.D. student in philosophy at Duke University, where I am a member of both the [Imagination and Modal Cognition Lab](https://www.imclab.org/) and the [Moral Attitudes and Decision-Making Lab](https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/mad-lab/). My primary interests are in moral psychology, the philosophy of cognitive science, and theoretical cognitive neuroscience. The central aim of my research is to understand how our moral thoughts and behavior are shaped by our social environment, past experiences, and features of the present situation (i.e., our current tasks, time constraints, etc.). Currently, I'm exploring how Bayesian and predictive theories of cognition may help us better explain and identify the various neurocognitive processes underlying our moral cognition, such as the formation of moral judgments, the representation of moral content, and the acquisition of moral knowledge.
