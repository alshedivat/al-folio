I am currently a Postdoc researcher in [Prof. WANG Cong's research group](https://cyber.cs.cityu.edu.hk/en/home/index.html){:target="\_blank"} at the City University of Hong Kong. I received my Ph.D degree in June 2022.

My research interests include *applied cryptography*, *blockchain*, and *network security*. Notably, my thesis comprehensively studies the undergoing decentralized storage projects such as Filecoin and Chia, and proposes efficient zero knowledge auditing designs for blockchain-enabled validation.

My favourite motto is *Pessimism of the Intellect, Optimism of the Will* by Antonio Gramsci. It always reminds me to overcome hidden biases and keep the courage to attempt difficult things.
