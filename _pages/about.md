Hello! My name is Matias Barandiaran and I am a second year computer science student at `Lancaster University`. I'm really passionate about machine learning, quantum software, and formal verification. I've been gaining practical experience through research placements and remote certifications, and I'm excited to take it further by exploring research assistant roles in these fields.

I am currently working on my Bachelor's dissertation with a focus on graph neural nets (`GNNs`) and graph cellular automata (`GCAs`).

Perhaps you found this website through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matias-barandiaran-rivera/)? If not, check it out! Either way, you can take a look at my CV or personal projects.

If you have an idea and want to see if Iâ€™d be interested in helping out, please contact me!
