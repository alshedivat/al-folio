Motivated from a summer project at IIT BHU on a study about our nearest star -- SUN, I have joined the PhD programme at CESSI IISER Kolkata under the supervision of Prof Dibyendu Nandy. During the course of my PhD I have tried to develop models, study observational data and devise new techniques to answer some of the above questions. Although some of the projects are still ongoing, this field of study developed a deep interest in me to explore further. Currently I am a Senior Research Fellow in
[Center of Excellence in Space Sciences India](http://www.cessi.in/) 
at [IISER Kolkata](http://www.iiserkol.ac.in/). I have completed my Master's degree on Theoretical Physics from Central University of Himachal Pradesh.
I am from Odisha, India -- a state with wide range of cultural virtues -- near east cost of India.
