My research interests include distributed algorithms with an emphasis on Byzantine fault tolerance, consensus, and shared randomness. 
I am particularly interested in such protocols in asynchronous and partially synchronous networks.

Recently, I've also been researching cryptography in distributed protocols, and the way these fields interact with each other.

My PhD advisors are <a href='https://research.vmware.com/researchers/ittai-abraham'>Ittai Abraham</a> and <a href='https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dolev/'>Danny Dolev</a>.
