Hello 👋

I'm Yash Sharma, a backend and Web3 engineer based in Delhi. Over the last two years at Stackera I've built high-throughput DeFi analytics and real-time gaming platforms that serve hundreds of thousands of blockchain events per day. I enjoy owning products end-to-end—from shaping data models and distributed services to tightening latency budgets and production readiness.

Most recently I:

- Ship FastAPI microservices, Redis-backed workers, and PostgreSQL schemas that power provably-fair betting games (Dice, Plinko, more in flight).
- Scaled DexCheck.io's multi-chain listeners (Ethereum, BSC, Base) with Web3.py, Kafka, and Prometheus, cutting processing latency by half while maintaining 120 ms P95 APIs.
- Designed transaction-safe execution workflows, partitioned analytics stores, and telemetry that keep partners confident in the data they consume.

Day to day you'll find me deep in Python, Web3 infrastructure, and observability dashboards—always looking for cleaner abstractions and better developer ergonomics. I'm currently open to backend or Web3 roles where I can keep building reliable, low-latency systems.
