My name is Yikai Wu <a href="https://www.name-coach.com/yikai-wu" target="_blank" title="Google Scholar"><i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i></a> (吴溢恺 in Chinese). I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Yale University. I am currently working with Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/vishnoi/Home.html">Nisheeth Vishnoi</a>.

My research interests lie on machine learning, differential privacy, and optimization. I am also broadly interested in theoretical computer science and quantum information science.

I have recently received my Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from <a href="https://www.duke.edu">Duke University</a>. At Duke, I have worked with Prof. <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ashwin/">Ashwin Machanavajjhala</a> on differential privacy, Prof. <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~rongge/">Rong Ge</a> on deep learning theory, and Prof. <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/marvian/">Iman Marvian</a> on quantum computation.

**Research interests:** machine learning, differential privacy, optimization
