Hi there. 👋

I'm a Full Stack Developer primarily working in the Java & Kotlin world on the server side with some experience building apps in NodeJS and Python as well. On the front end side of the house I primarily work in ReactJS with some limited knowledge of Angular.

Currently I'm an engineer at **[@Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/)** and previously **[@Cigna](https://www.cigna.com/)**.  I have a Masters in Computer Science from **[@Stevens](https://www.stevens.edu/)** and a Bachelors in Finance from **[@Rutgers](https://www.rutgers.edu/)**.

I love keeping up to date with technology, finance and the intersection of the two.  I also dabble a bit in Rust on the [@Solana](https://solana.com/) network
