I work at Apple, focusing on the intersection of machine learning and health.

Previously at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/), I contributed to a range of projects, from developing data-efficient machine learning techniques for graph neural networks to creating multimodal perception models integrating text, and olfactory inputs. My work spanned applications in biomedical research, olfaction, and gastronomy. 

<!-- My research is motivated by the goal of <i>modeling</i> and <i>synthesizing</i>  a multimodal perception system using ML tools. To achieve data efficiency, I also work on developing <i>active and transfer learning</i> algorithms for data-scarce domains, including biomedical, computer vision, natural language processing, and AI for science applications. -->

<!-- My research is motivated by the goal of <i>modeling</i> and <i>synthesizing</i> a multisensory (vision, speech, haptic, olfaction, and taste) perception system using machine learning tools. To achieve data efficiency, I also work on developing <i>active learning</i> algorithms to reduce the annotation load in supervised methods.  -->

I received my Ph.D. from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), advised by [Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/main/main.html) and [Prof. Siddhartha Chaudhuri](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sidch/). My thesis was on <i>Label-Efficient Distance Metric Learning</i>. Before that, I completed my master's also from IIT Bombay where I developed multimodal rendering techniques that combined haptic, visual, and auditory feedback to make 3D models of heritage sites accessible to the visually impaired.
