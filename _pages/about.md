Hi! I'm Lydia Kondylidou, a PhD student at the department of Theoretical Computer Science and Theorem Proving of LMU under the supervision of Prof. Jasmin Blanchette.

I'm interested in automated reasoning, particularly automated theorem proving and higher order logic. 
My PhD subject is achieving higher-order SMT solving by ensuring that extensions of SMT solvers natively support higher-order reasoning.
