I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins University. I am a member of the [Intuitive Computing Laboratory](https://intuitivecomputing.github.io/) (affiliated with the [Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare](https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/)). I am advised by [Dr. Chien-Ming Huang](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cmhuang/) and [Dr. Anqi Liu](https://anqiliu-ai.github.io/)!

My research focuses on human-AI trust and reliance in assisted decision-making. More specifically, I am interested in ways to help users calibrate their reliance and trust in the AI for more optimal human-AI collaboration.
