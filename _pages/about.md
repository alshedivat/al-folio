Hi! Welcome to my website, where I have tried to put my analytics journey in perspective. I am a data professional with 5+ years of experience, interested in working in the interesection of tech and social impact. I currently work as a Data Analytics Freelancer at [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0162236444b2794456?viewMode=1). 

My most recent work was to make sense of sparsely colleced media data by the client over 2 years to inform their investment portfolio for the upcoming year. Overcoming this challenge of inadequate data, I was able to analyze [footfall data against the basket of digital media investments](https://github.com/detectorisk/Digital_media_affect_on_footfall/tree/main) made by the client to inform next year's investment portfolio. 

Recently I graduated with distinction in MSc Data Analytics from the University of Strathclyde, where I honed my skills across advanced machine learning tools, data warehousing, and upskiller by programming proficiency in Python, R, SQL, PowerBI etc. My strong background in research, experience with a wide variety of data munging tools, as well as the ability to effectively communicate insights to stakeholders, places me well for Data Analyst/Insight Analyst/ Business Analyst roles.

I am always looking for opportunities in industries where my work will create value add and help build strong data teams. 

Contact me at <b> kevin.kuriakose.official@gmail.com </b> if my profile is of interest to your business!

Some of the Ongoing works:<brr>
<dd>-Analyzing footfall data in Glasgow for business placement in the city</dd>
<dd>-Evaluating consumer behaviour and digital media</dd>
