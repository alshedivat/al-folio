Hi! I'm a theoretical particle physicist at [SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/), Stanford University, mainly interested in interpet\
ing the data from the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) (LHC) in terms of its implications for possible new particl\
es and forces beyond the Standard Model. I am also fascinated by Machine Learning, and I've spent the largest fraction of my time in the past few years investigating h\
ow it can be used to better interpret LHC data and possibly to find new physics. I've recently been particularly obsessed with Variational Autoencoders and information\
 bottlenecks in general, and the way in which they can generate interesting learnt representations of their training data.

I spend my free time folding.
