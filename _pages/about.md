I'm PhD Student at <a href="https://lids.mit.edu/people/faculty-pi">MIT LIDS</a>, advised by <a href="https://azizan.mit.edu/index.html">Prof. Navid Azizan</a>. My current research interest lies in developing a safe and flexible machine learning framework.

I was an AI research engineer at <a href="https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic">NAVER AI Lab & CLOVA</a>.
At NAVER, I researched <strong>generalizable representation learning</strong> for temporal and relational data, while developing a large-scale recommender system and demand forecasting system.

I received my B.S. and M.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering from KAIST in 2017 and 2019, respectively, 
under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v5hGAWMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Han-Lim Choi</a>.
During my master’s degree, I researched 1) <strong>efficient planning and control frameworks </strong> and 2) <strong> hierarchical RL </strong> to bridge the gap between high-level reasoning and low-level control policies, for robots (e.g., humanoid).
