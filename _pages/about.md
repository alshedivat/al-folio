I am a fifth year PhD student at the [Paul Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at University of Washington supervised by [Sara Mostafavi](http://saramostafavi.github.io). Before my PhD, I earned BSs in Biology and Computer Science from Peking University. During my undergraduate, I did some bioinformatics research at [Gao Lab](http://www.gao-lab.org/index.php/en/home/). Please see my [CV](https://xinmingtu.cn/cv/) for more information.

My research interest spans two interconnected directions. First, I work on **AI for Regulatory Genomics**, including sequence-to-function prediction, multi-omics integration, and perturbation modeling—with a growing focus on developing agentic systems that can autonomously design and execute experiments. Second, I am expanding toward **AI for Open-ended Science Discovery**, creating LLM-based agents capable of autonomous reasoning and discovery across diverse scientific domains. My goal is to accelerate the arrival of the AI Scientist itself.
