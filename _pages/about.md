Hello, I am Heejong Bong. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](http://stat.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before I came to CMU, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/), Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea in 2017. I also worked as a drill instructor for 2 years (2013-2015) in Republic of Korea Air Force.

My research interest is in understanding how mammal brains analyze rewarding patterns and change behaviors more adaptive. I am approaching this problem with statistical analyses on neural recordings during behaviors followed  by rewards. In CMU, I am participating to NeuroStats lab group and advised on my thesis by [Robert E. Kass](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/) and [Valerie Ventura](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~vventura) on Discovery of functional predictivity across brain regions from local field potentials.

I am defending soon (early July) and looking for postdoctoral research positions starting F22.
