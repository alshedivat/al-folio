I am a software engineer with professional interests in quant trading and AI.

In my spare time, I like to play various sports, and my favorite ones are basketball, tennis, snowboarding, and bouldering. Had some previous endeavors towards novel writing in Mandarin. It turned out to be kinda cheesy. If you'd like to take a look of my writing, please DM me and I would very much like to consider mailing you a paperback of my only work so far for free. You don't necessarily need to buy it [here](https://store.showwe.tw/books.aspx?b=129215) in order to read it.

Please also feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or shoot me an email for future collabs on side projects, hackathons, or other endeavors. I speak Mandarin and English. Cheers!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
