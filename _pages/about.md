I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [Department of Psychology](https://psych.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at Princeton University. I work in the [Princeton Baby Lab](https://babylab.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I study language - how we learn it and what we do with it.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
