I have been a Data Scientist at Western Digital since 2018. Previously, I was part of Dr. Malik Magdon-Ismail's Learning From Data Lab at Rensselear where I got my PhD. I also have an MS in Computer Science from University of Minnesota. Some of my research interests include machine learning on networks, object detection and segmentation using deep learning and learning from tabular data. Feel free to [reach out](https://topmate.io/hegde) to me to talk about any of these topics or more!
