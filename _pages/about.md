I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [Department of Psychology](https://psych.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at Princeton University. I work in the [Princeton Baby Lab](https://babylab.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. 

Before coming to Princeton, I completed my PhD in Cognitive/ Developmental Psychology in the [Infant Learning Lab](https://infantlearning.waisman.wisc.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working with Jenny Saffran and Gary Lupyan.

<strong>I study language - how we learn it and what we do with it.</strong>
