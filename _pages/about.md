Hi! My name is Chams and I like to build things to solve Computer Science problems,
create automated solutions and programs that tries to mimic the Human Behavior.
<br/>I'm very interested in Machine Learning with a focus on Deep Learning,
Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, and Psychology.
<br/>My [projects](/projects) are mostly related to these fields and are available on [github](https://github.com/ChamsToure).

The rest of the time I play and [coach basketball](https://www.vfl-oldesloe.de/basketball), and [run long distances](https://www.strava.com/athletes/70311685)
