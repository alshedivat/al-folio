I'm a third year PhD student at the UCLA linguistics department.

My research focuses on morphology and its interfaces with phonology and syntax. I am particularly interested in the acquisition of morphological processes.

I also do fieldwork on San Cristóbal Lachirioag Zapotec, a Northern Zapotec language from the Villa Alta district of Oaxaca, Mexico.
