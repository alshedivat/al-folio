Recent Master’s graduate specialized in Machine Learning and Data Science, bringing over three years of research experience in the field. Currently working as a Machine Learning and Data Researcher, I am actively seeking opportunities to further my career in the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning.

I enjoy reading comics, cooking, table tennis, watching anime and, playing Dota2!
