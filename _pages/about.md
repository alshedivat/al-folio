Hi! I’m a PhD student in [Information Science at Cornell](https://infosci.cornell.edu/phd/), where I study algorithmic fairness under the supervision of [Allison Koenecke](https://koenecke.infosci.cornell.edu/) and [Rene Kizilcec](https://rene.kizilcec.com/). I'm currently working as a research assistant on the ["Expanding AI Audits"](https://techethicslab.nd.edu/call-for-proposals/#:~:text=Expanding,-AI%20Audits%20to) team at NYU, and have collaborated on research with the [Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/) and the [Compliant and Accountable Systems lab](https://www.compacctsys.net/) at the University of Cambridge.

I'm also really excited about teaching ethical AI - most recently, I co-led a [Responsible AI course](https://nanrahman.github.io/capstone-responsible-ai/) for UCSD's Data Science Capstone.

Previously, I worked as a data scientist at a consulting firm, where I focused on conducting real-world algorithm audits. I received my BA in Computer Science and Philosophy, Politics, & Economics from the University of Pennsylvania.
