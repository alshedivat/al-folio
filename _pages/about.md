I am a Threat Hunter with a passion for digging deep into logs and exploring raw data. My favorite tools are Kusto, Kibana, MISP, and WSL2.
Beyond work, I love taking part in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, hitting the mountain bike trails, or experimenting with new cocktail recipes as a hobby mixologist.
