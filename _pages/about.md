Hello! I am Luca Fehlings, a Scientist and Ph.D. student at NaMLab gGmbH and TU Dresden respectively.
Currently, I research ferroelectric HfO2-based devices and their integration into neuromorphic CMOS circuits. Together with my colleagues I am realizing circuit building blocks that allow learning on biological time-scales in hardware.

My research interests cover the topics of process integration, compact modeling and electrical characterization of semiconductor and memory devices, particularly regarding their integrability and reliability.

I hold a B.Sc and M.Sc degree from RWTH Aachen in Electrical Engineering, which I received in 2019 and 2022. During that time I worked on photonics, 2D-materials and organic semiconductors.
