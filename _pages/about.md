I am an MA student in the [Department of Philosophy](https://www.uh.edu/class/philosophy/) at the University of Houston. 

My current research lies at the intersection of ethics, moral psychology, and theories of human agency, with an eye toward incorporating insights from undertheorized Latin American thinkers into discussions of value and rational action within analytic philosophy. I investigate how our choices shape who we are as moral agents and what we value, how we ought to reconcile internal conflicts between our values, the role of the emotions in our practical and moral reasoning, and how our identities and social practices give shape to human agency. 


Outside of philosophy, I enjoy cuddling with my cat, making jewelry and pottery, drinking coffee, traveling, and getting lost in bookshops with my [husband](http://phkieval.com).
