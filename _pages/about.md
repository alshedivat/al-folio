I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working under the mentorship of Professors Liza Levina and Ji Zhu. My research focuses on causal inference on networks, a challenging and rapidly evolving area in statistics. 

Previously, I have explored a range of topics, including spatiotemporal methods, graphical models, causal inference on time-series data, high-dimensional central limit theorems, and ranking from pairwise comparisons. For more details on my current and past research, please visit my [projects](/projects/) page.

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I was advised by Professors Robert E. Kass and Valérie Ventura. My doctoral work centered on developing and rigorously testing statistical methods to decode communication between brain regions using complex neural recordings. To address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data, I introduced latent factor time-series models and matrix-variate graphical models. 

Following my Ph.D., I spent an additional year as a postdoctoral researcher at CMU, during which I collaborated on three significant projects with Professors Robert E. Kass, Valérie Ventura, Larry Wasserman, Zhao Ren, Alessandro Rinaldo, and Arun Kuchibhotla.
