Hello, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Purdue University. My research focuses on causal inference for data with complex dependence structures such as longitudinal and network data, a challenging and rapidly evolving area of statistics with broad applications in public health and the social sciences.

Beyond this core area, I have worked on diverse topics, including spatiotemporal methods, graphical models, causal inference for time-series data, high-dimensional central limit theorems, and ranking from pairwise comparisons. For more details on both current and past research, please see my [projects](/projects/) page.

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), advised by Professors Robert E. Kass and Val√©rie Ventura. My doctoral research developed statistical methods to decode communication between brain regions using high-dimensional neural recordings, introducing latent factor time-series models and matrix-variate graphical models.

Following my Ph.D., I spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher at CMU, collaborating with Professors Kass, Ventura, Larry Wasserman, Zhao Ren, Alessandro Rinaldo, and Arun Kuchibhotla on several theoretical and applied projects. I then continued as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan, working with Professors Elizaveta Levina, Ji Zhu, and Colin B. Fogarty on causal inference under network interference.
