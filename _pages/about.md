Hello there! My name is Albert Yoshimoto. I am a violinist and composer from El Paso, Texas. I am currently working on getting my Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Texas at El Paso. I earned my Bachelor of Music in Violin Performance from New Mexico State University, under the tutelage of esteemed violin pedagogue Daniel Vega Albela.
