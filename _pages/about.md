Welcome to my personal website! Here you can learn a little about myself, my interests, current projects, and important information/resources (in Spanish) for my courses. 

I am a PhD student at Universidad Iberoamericana under the guidance of Dr. Jorge Ángel González Ordiano, Dr. José Emilio Quiroz Ibarra, and Dr. Steve Simske. The research topic is *Multimodal Sentiment Analysis on Digital Social Networks*.

Additionally, I have the fortune to work teaching undergraduates at the university since spring 2022. Teaching urges you to improve and update your knowledge, thus challenging yourself to be a better academic for your student's sake.

Feel free to lurk around!
