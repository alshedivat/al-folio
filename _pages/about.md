My name is Joe and I am a social psychology PhD student at the University of Toronto. In the last 6 years of my research, I have frequently used both quantitative (e.g., experiments) and qualitative research methods (e.g., semi-structure interviews, focus groups) to address my research questions. I have experience with experimental design, survey, A/B testing (traditional and adaptive), statistical analysis, data visualization and programming. I have given guest lectures at undergraduate courses at the University of Toronto and my research has been presented at academic conferences (e.g., Society for Industrial/Organizational Psychology). 

I study why people identify with different beliefs and ideologies (e.g., liberalism vs. conservatism) and what are the antecedents and consequences to believing how malleable or fixed we believe different attributes of the world to be (e.g., how does our beliefs about the malleability of intelligence affect how much we support education policies).

I also study how different attributes contribute towards being a good leader, the benefits of diversity in the workplace, the effects of incivility in higher education and how problem-based learning can benefit student writing. 

I do digital art for fun. Check out the miscellaneous tab!g
