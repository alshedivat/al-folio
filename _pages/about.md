<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hey! I am a final year electronics undergrad student at [Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI).](https://vjti.ac.in) Throughout my undergrad I have explored many fields be it Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Software Development etc. The one that struck with me is Machine Learning.
One of the most fascinating aspects of machine learning is its ability to learn from data, just as humans learn from their experiences. This involves using mathematical algorithms to analyze and interpret large amounts of data, such as images or text, and make predictions or decisions based on that information.
Currently, I am working on various applications of Machine Learning and Natural Language processing. Previously, I have worked a lot in LLM through internships and personal projects.
I am open for opportunities in the field of Machine Learning/ AI, Software Development
