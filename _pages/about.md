I am a graduate student at the [Department of Computer Sciences](https://cs.wisc.edu){:target="_blank"}, [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu){:target="_blank"}. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Aditya Akella](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~akella/) at the Wisconsin Internet and Systems Research ([WISR](https://wisr.cs.wisc.edu/)) group. I am broadly interested in Systems and Networking, with a focus on understanding the fundamental challenges that the current networked systems face. I'm fascinated by questions such as "Can we bring datacenter-like capabilities to the end-users?" or "What are the fundamental constraints in the networking devices we use?". As a long term goal, it is my desire to bridge the gap between research and ground reality by working on socially utilizable projects.

Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} majoring in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitd.ac.in){:target="_blank"} where I met and made friends with some absolutely amazing and competent people. I hail from [Lucknow](https://goo.gl/maps/yNiHPh9WgNbjwPeH9){:target="_blank"}, a city in North India.
