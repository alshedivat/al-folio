Hi, call me Mew for short. I am a Natural Language Processing Engineer at [Square Enix AI & Arts Alchemy](https://www.squareenix-alchemy.com/), a start-up under the Square Enix group focusing on R&D of products involving AI, computer graphics, and arts.

I learned about [Concept drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_drift) in grad school, but it's not that popular so I picked up [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) on my first job, and have been working on it ever since.

I earned my master's degree in Information Science in 2018 from Osaka University, and bachelor's in Computer Engineering in 2015 from Chulalongkorn University.
