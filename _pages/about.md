I am currently a postdoctoral associate at MIT, hosted by [Gregory W. Wornell](http://allegro.mit.edu/~gww/).
Prior to joining MIT, I received my Ph.D. in [Electrical Engineering](https://ece.ucsd.edu/) from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), 
where I was fortunate to be advised by [Young-Han Kim](https://web.eng.ucsd.edu/~yhk/) and [Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/).
My graduate study was generously supported by the [Kwanjeong Educational Foundation](http://www.ikef.or.kr/).
Before the graduate study, I received my B.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en) and B.S. in [Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.snu.ac.kr/) (with minor in [Physics](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en)) with the highest distinction from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr) in 2015.

My recent research topics include:
- operator decomposition with neural networks and its applications;
- generative models (esp. energy-based models);
- learning with uncertainty;
- universal information processing.

As an information theorist by training, 
I do research by simplifying complicated ideas, unifying concepts, and generalizing them to complex problems.
