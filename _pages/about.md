I am a **senior undergraduate student** in the <a href='https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst'>Department of Management Science and Technology</a> of **Athens University of Economics and Business**. I am also a **research associate** at <a href='https://www.balab.aueb.gr'>BALab</a>, where I conduct research related to software engineering and programming languages, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/index.el.html'>Diomidis Spinellis</a>.

I am also a **research affiliate** at the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/">Computer Science Department </a> of **Brown University**, working on the <a href='https://binpa.sh'>PaSh</a> project, a shell-script parallelization project hosted by the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/linux-foundation-to-host-the-pash-project-accelerating-shell-scripting-with-automated-parallelization-for-industrial-use-cases">Linux Foundation</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href='http://nikos.vasilak.is/'>Nikos Vasilakis</a>.

My **research interests** include programming languages, software analytics, empirical software engineering and computer systems. I am always willing to share ideas and embrace discussions with anyone, whether it be directly related to the above topics or not. I find the field of security particularly interesting but had not yet studied it in depth.

In my **free time**, I enjoy a variety of indoor and outdoor activities. I really enjoy long-distance running and cycling (feel free to follow me on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/56433360">Strava</a>), either alone or with the company of other people. Furthermore, I enjoy listening to music and creating <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/5tjsyyq952wsk4sm0sbog24yu?si=5e993390c0c64304">Spotify playlists</a>. My favourite genres include Classic and Alternative Rock, Indie and Jazz, but many other genres are also of my interest.
