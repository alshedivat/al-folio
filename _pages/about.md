I am a Ph.D student at [Tohoku University](https://www.eng.tohoku.ac.jp/english/). He received his Ph.D. in Information Science and Technology from the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) in 2025, advised by [Assoc. Prof. Yusuke Tamura](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=Z1PbGrMAAAAJ). His research interests include mobile robot and human-robot interaction. In particular, I am interested in the social navigation and pedestrian trajectory prediction.
