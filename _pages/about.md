I am a Machine Learning enthusiast with keen interest in the field of Computer Vision. I have received my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University, Nepal with <b>`summa cum laude`(9th Rank in University)</b> . I have been involved in Robotics Club, Pulchowk Campus, and participated in the international Robotic Competition `ABU Robocon` in 2019. My research interest are in computer vision, particularly in medical imaging,perception through camera i.e., understanding scene and feaures in images of the real world and its application to solve real world problems.

I have two years of experience in research and industry sector. I have been invovled in projects where i have worked on projects based on computer vision acquiring tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, image classification, optical character recognition, image similarity, feature matching,multiview geometry, 3D vision, point clouds, depth estimation. Currently I am seeking for <b>`Research Assistant position`</b> where I could increase my skill and knowledge and contribute in research projects.
