I'm a Venezuelan physicist, AI & Finance enthusiast, with passion for problem solving and software development. I'm currently pursuing a PhD at ICTQT, in the university of Gdansk. My work focuses on the description of open quantum systems, particularly in Non-Markovian equations focusing on the Refined Weak coupling/ExpZ map/ cumulant equation for which I wrote a [python package](https://github.com/OQS-ICTQT/cumulant.py), Throughout my PhD I've spent a lot of time checking out and testing different techniques for the description of open systems such as HEOM, the reaction coordinate mapping, The time convolutionless equation (TCL), TEDOPA ... etc, I believe this has given me a deeper insight on Open quantum systems from the point of view of where approximations fail or hold, and whether we can trust certain effects from approximate descriptions.

I was born in Maracaibo in 1996, however I grew up in Valera,Trujillo. I'm proud to call myself "Gocho", I was a scout for about 11 years, and it shaped the person I am today, I believe I am a better person because of all the experiences and people I met in the movement over the years.

I started off my career as an electronics engineer, I later did a masters in experimental quantum optics at CINVESTAV, and now I'm pursuing a PhD in open quantum systems at ICTQT under the supervision of Michal Horodecki. I was previously an Intern at RIKEN  where I worked on enhancements on the qutip HEOM package, that started me off contributing to open source which I actively try to do. I also have some experience as a python developer/data analyst on upwork, which was my focus prior to starting my PhD

In my free time I enjoy anime, cooking,  video games, and trading, while I mainly avoid actively trading, I do have some fun selling some weekly covered calls once in a while.
