I am Horacio Chacon Torrico, a Global Health Master in Public Health (MPH) from the [Department of Global Health](https://globalhealth.washington.edu) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu). I workded as a Research Assistant at [I-TECH](https://www.go2itech.org) supporting the M&E data collection system from a Care and Treatment program in Zimbabwe. My work focus on the intersection of technology, data, and public health, and how to better use data to measure health outcomes in middle- and low-income countries. I will be pursuing a Global Health: Health Metrics and Evaluation PhD program at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://www.healthdata.org) starting Fall 2022.

**Research Interests:**

For my master thesis I researched the drivers of spatial-temporal heterogeneity in COVID-19 outcomes in Peru with [Dr. Bobby Reiner](https://www.healthdata.org/about/bobby-reiner). I am also interested in population health metrics, health data science, biomedical informatics, surveillance and health systems, with a special emphasis in Low and Middle income countries.

**Previously:**

I hold M.Sc in Biomedical Informatics from [Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia](www.catetano.edu.pe) where I worked designing a maternal and child health program that aided with a mHealth application for Community Health Workers and community-based components approach, aimed to monitor pregnant women and newborns in remote basin native communities
