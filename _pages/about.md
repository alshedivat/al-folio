Hi, this is Alan (周俊哲) ! I am a first-year (almost second-year) Ph.D. student at [CMU Physics](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/). I work on cosmology, astrophysics, and statistical inference. Currently, I am using deep probabilistic models to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of our universe using large observational data sets. I am also a part of the [McWilliams Center for Cosmology](https://www.cmu.edu/cosmology/) and the [NSF AI Planning Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ai-physics-institute/) at CMU. Most of my work is done at the Perlmutter supercomputer at NERSC and the Bridges-2 supercomputer at the PSC.

## A short non-academic bio:
I grew up in Beijing, China. I attended high school in [Pebble Beach CA](https://stevensonschool.org/) (after a short stay in Miami), went to [Duke University](https://duke.edu/), and am currently at [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu/). I enjoy exploring all the little corners of this world! Before working on cosmology, I researched at the Large Hadron Collider at [CERN](https://www.home.cern/) in Geneva, did classical archeology and early modern art history in Rome, studied at the [Duke Kunshan](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/) campus near Shanghai, and was very interested in [QFT and nuclear theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13780)! I was incredibly lucky to have met so many great mentors, who showed me how all these fields shared the same indelible human touch. I am really looking forward to sharing some of this journey here, and please bear with me as I figure out how this website works!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
