I am a fifth year PhD student at the [Paul Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at University of Washington supervised by [Sara Mostafavi](http://saramostafavi.github.io). Before my PhD, I earned BSs in Biology and Computer Science from Peking University. During my undergraduate, I did some bioinformatics research at [Gao Lab](http://www.gao-lab.org/index.php/en/home/). Please see my [CV](https://xinmingtu.cn/cv/) for more information.

My research interest is using machine learning to decipher the principle of biology, especially for genomics. Recently my research focuses on studying regulatory genomics under the single-cell context, including sequence to function framework, multi-omics representation, and perturbation modeling.
