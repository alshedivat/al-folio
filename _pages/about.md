Ciao 👋

I'm Alessandro and I'm a PhD candidate at EPFL in the [Physics of Complex Systems Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/pcsl/) and the [Signal Processing Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/), co-advised by Matthieu Wyart and Pascal Frossard.

The goal of my research is to advance the understanding of modern machine learning. I primarily focus on the *statistical aspects of deep learning* and the interplay between *data structure* and generalization. In particular, I'm interested in elucidating what structures in real data (e.g., symmetries, invariances, scale separation) allow for *efficient learning* in high dimensions.

I enjoy working both studying analytical models and performing numerical experiments.

Before, I completed a joint Master's degree in *theoretical physics* at Sorbonne Université, Politecnico di Torino, SISSA, and ICTP.
