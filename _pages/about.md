I am currently working toward the Phd degree in [Prof. WANG Cong's research group](https://cyber.cs.cityu.edu.hk/en/home/index.html){:target="\_blank"} at the City University of Hong Kong. My research interests include *applied cryptography*, *blockchain*, and *network security*. Notably, my thesis comprehensively studies the undergoing decentralized storage projects such as Filecoin and Chia, and proposes efficient zero knowledge auditing designs for blockchain-enabled validation.

In my leisure time, I enjoy exploring the following topics: *cognitive science*, *deep learning for NLP*, *cosmology*, *management science*, *paranormal events* and history of science in general. 

I love stargazing from time to time and my favourite game is *Capitalism II* by Enlight Software.
