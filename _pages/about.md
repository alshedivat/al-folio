I'm a PhD student in economics at Boston University. My research focuses on economic history, political economy and development economics. I'm interested in applying machine learning and text analysis methods.

I'm also a lab manager at <a href="https://www.industrialpolicygroup.com">The Industrial Policy Group</a>, an empirical research lab, founded by <a href="https://www.rjuhasz.com">Dr. Réka Juhász</a> and <a href="https://www.nathanlane.info">Dr. Nathan Lane</a>, that aims to deliver core empirical research surrounding industrial policy, and make industrial policy a serious object of economic study.

I hold a BSc and MA in economics from Universidad de los Andes. I previously
worked as a predoctoral fellow at <a href="https://econ.columbia.edu/per/">PER</a>. I'm originally from  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteria"> Montería</a>, Córdoba, Colombia.
