Greetings,

I am Julián Pierino Pedrazzi, a junior researcher at CEDLAS (Centro de Estudios Distributivos, Laborales y Sociales). I hold a Master's in Economics from the Faculty of Economic Sciences in La Plata and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics at the same institution. Explore my primary research on this site..

Best regards,
JPP.
