<b> ...a little about me</b> <br>
I was an Engineering Science[ ](https://youtu.be/BcPO4yhWSUg) student major in Engineering Physics at the University of Toronto. I am interested in computational physics, dynamical systems, numerical (spectral methods) approaches to fluid mechanics, and all the other fields in physics.

in Chinese, last name is placed in the front, <br> so my name actually goes as: 周 润东, with [pīnyīn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) Zh&#333u R&#249nd&#333ng


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
