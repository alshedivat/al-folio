I have started my Professional life as a Computational Physicist. <br>  
Today I am a rounded IT professional with a background in IT Services, performance marketing and digital sales. Following the momentum of our times I completed a Data Science Bootcamp which has revealed a whole new world of Data Science and Data Analysis.<br>  
Curious how this will affect our world in the years to come.
