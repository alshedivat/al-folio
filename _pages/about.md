I am a [Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) student at the University of Toronto. My graduate studies focus on artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in generative models, natural language processing (NLP).

Previously, I studied [Engineering Physics](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/engphys/) at McMaster University, where I was focused primarily on semiconductor devices and quantum computing. I was also a research intern at Perimeter Institute, the world's largest theoretical physics research hub, where I had the opportunity to work at the intersection of machine learning and physics. 

As of January 2024, I will be seeking full-time opportunities for machine learning engineer/scientist roles.



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
