Detail-oriented individual, uniquely educated and experienced in business at the nexus of finance, accounting, and data science/analytics. Exceptionally fast learner, adaptable, and decisive. Straightforward, honest, and articulate communicator. Passionate about scalable, modular, data-driven systems and processes that move the business forward.

In my free time I enjoy acro, weightlifting, yoga, running, reading, and volunteering with [Tech Journey](https://www.techjourney.org/). I'm also an ISSA certified run coach. I live in Iowa with my husband, two alien dogs in cat suits, and dog.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
