I am the Assistant Director of [Digital Scholarship](https://tischlibrary.tufts.edu/about-library/about/staff-directory/departments/235) & [Lilly Music Library](https://tischlibrary.tufts.edu/our-locations/tisch-branches/lilly-music-library) at Tufts University. My academic training includes master’s degrees in library and information science from Simmons College, music with a concentration in musicology from Tufts University, as well as a bachelor of arts in music literature and performance from Northeastern University. I am also the co-founder of [Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online](https://www.sucho.org/), an initiative focused on safeguarding and preserving the digital cultural heritage of Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

I am interested in exploring the affordances and application of digital humanities tools and methods in historical (music) research, in the application of standards, including TEI and MEI, for open access research and publishing, and the use of minimal computing. I also work on nineteenth century music topics with a focus on gender, women, and performance criticism and reception. My publications include a book entitled [*The Life and Music of Teresa Carreño (1853-1917): A Guide to Research*](https://www.areditions.com/kijas-life-and-music-of-teresa-carre-o-ib041.html), and open-access projects, including [Documenting Teresa Carreño](https://documentingcarreno.org/) centered around Carreño's performance career (1863-1917) and [Rebalancing the Music Canon](https://rebalancing-music-canon.com/) that aims to make musical works by historically marginalized and un(der)-represented people more discoverable, decenter the musical canon, and make data-driven music scholarship more diverse and inclusive. I also write about using digital humanities tools and methods to explore, visualize, and augment scholarship.

Since 2021, I have been Editor for the [Technical Reports & Monographs in Music Librarianship](https://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/page/techreports) series. I serve as the Administrative Chair of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) and during 2019-2023 I served as an Executive Council Representative of the Association for Computers and the Humanities. 

My work and contributions have been recognized with awards including [A. Ralph Papakhian Special Achievement Award (MLA)](https://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/page/PapakhianAward), [European Heritage Award / Europa Nostra Award 2023](https://www.sucho.org/press-release-20230613-award), [Society of American Archivists Council Resolution](https://www2.archivists.org/council-resolution-saving-ukrainian-cultural-heritage-online), [Walter Gerboth Award (MLA)](http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/?page=gerbothaward&terms=%22gerboth%22), as well as intramural awards and grants.
