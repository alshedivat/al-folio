I am a mathematician currently pursuing my Master's degree in Mathematics at Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico (UNAM), where I recently graduated with honors from my bachelor's program. My primary research interests lie in modelling biological systems, particularly cancer.

During my academic journey, I've focused on integrating theoretical frameworks with computational methods. I enjoy translating complex theoretical concepts into practical implementations using programming languages such as Julia, Python, and MATLAB. 

In my free time to take pictures You can see some of them in my [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/digitalteporingo)
