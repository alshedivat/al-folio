> **[Join us!](/join-us/overview/)** 👩‍🎓🧑‍🏫👩‍⚕️🙋‍♂️ We are looking for several **PhD students or Postdocs** and **student assistants**.
You will work on [projects](projects) encompassing for example extracting and integrating domain knowledge from and into machine learning methods in the context of high-impact applications like (bio-)medicine and environmental change.

The **Becker Lab** is a you machine learning lab with a strong international network including for example Stanford University, UC San Diego, or UNC Chapel Hill.
We aim to **impact high-stake real-world problem settings** at the intersection of **medicine, environmental change, and human behavior** through **artificial intelligence and machine learning**.
For this, we **develop novel approaches and methodology** in close collaboration with practitioners and domain experts that enable **unprecedented insights into complex systems**.
This allows us to directly impact real-world scenarios like local patient populations or ecosystems maximizing translational and synergetic effects of our work.
In this context, the main focus of our group is threefold:

* **understanding complex systems** by extracting novel insights into their underlying processes,
* **modeling complex systems** by integrating existing domain knowledge into machine learning methods,
* and developing methods for **knowledge management, representation, and interaction**.

Our approaches range from multi-modal learning, network analysis, and exceptional model mining to Bayesian modeling, deep learning, representation learning, explainable AI, and human computer interaction.
