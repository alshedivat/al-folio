Pre-Final Year Master's student at IIT (BHU) Varanasi

Hi! I am Samyak.  I am pursuing integrated Bachelor and Master of Technology in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse) at the [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varansi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/). For the last few years I have been broadly working on Machine Learning with a particular focus on Adversarial Robustness along with Generalizable and Explainable Machine Learning.
\\
\\
I have been working at the [Video Analytics Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) and have been involved in deep learning projects particularly related to adversarial robustness and understanding the loss landscape of neural networks from the perspective of sharper/wider minima, which have been published at the following [venues](./publications).
\\
I have worked with the [Theoretical foundations in AI](https://www.in.tum.de/tfai/people/students-and-interns) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) where I worked on understanding the learning dynamics, loss landscape and critical point solutions of linear neural networks. Besides this I actively participate in machine learning conferences and have served as a reviewer at multiple conferences and won outstanding reviewer awards at ICLR 2022 and CVPR 2022.

Here is the link to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PfF1jzE_9ARl5qiSIzg27UI0gD4NEjbc/view?usp=sharing).
\\
\\
Broadly I am interested in research topics related to:
\\
**Robustness:** Adversarial Robustness, Domain Generalization, OOD Robustness, Explainable AI
\\
**Theory:** Generalization, Learning dynamics, Critical point solutions, Linear autoencoder
\\
**Generative models:** GANS, VAE, Diffusion models
