Hello! I’m a Postdoc in the School of ECEE at Arizona State University, hosted by [Lalitha Sankar](https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/), [Oliver Kosut](https://sites.google.com/site/okosut/), and [Gautam Dasarathy](https://www.public.asu.edu/~gdasarat/). I currently work on some cool yet important estimation and control problems in power systems. In my free time, I listen to audiobooks on philosophical aspects of ethics and science; and think about my dense hair I had half a decade ago.

I received a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from University of California, Riverside, under the supervision of [Fabio Pasqualetti](https://www.fabiopas.it/), where I worked on <a href="assets/pdf/raj_PHD_thesis2019.pdf">security of stochastic dynamical systems</a>. During my PhD studies, I took a bunch of courses in Statistics and earned a MS degree, but I remember only 51.32% of the material.


My research identifies situations where <strong>estimation, identification, and control</strong> problems in large-scale interconnected network systems (e.g., power and structural systems) can be solved using efficient computational algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Topics of current interests:

- estimation and control
   - sparse state and input estimation in dynamical systems
   - controllability of coarse dynamical systems
   - structured system identification
   - structure learning in graphical models
   - attack design and detection in network systems
- applications to power systems
   - parameter estimation in low-inertia systems
   - topology identification in distribution grids
   - oscillations and cyber-attack mitigation in bulk systems
