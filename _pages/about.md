<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

Hey! I am a Final year Electronics undergrad student at [Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI).](https://vjti.ac.in) 

Throughout my undergrad I have explored many fields be it `Machine Learning`, `Deep Learning`, `Computer Vision`, `Software Development` etc. The one that struck with me is Machine Learning.

As a Researcher, I’m broadly interested in all aspects of machine learning, and particularly in probabilistic modeling, deep learning, robust and scalable data-driven systems, and applications to life and engineering sciences.

Previously, I was `Google Summer of Code Mentor` at Joomla CMS!.(2022). In the summer of 2022, I had also worked as an `MITACS Globalink Research Intern` at Polytechnique Montréal, where my research was on the IDF Curve data using Machine Learning and its application. In 2021, I got selected as `Open Source Promotion Plan Fellow(OSPP)` by `Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences(ISCAS)` & `Open-Euler`, where I worked with `Joomla CMS!`  

Currently, I am working on various applications of Machine Learning and Natural Language processing. Previously, I have worked a lot in LLM through internships and personal projects.
I am open for opportunities in the field of `Machine Learning/ AI`, `Software Development`

In my spare time, I enjoy watching Anime & Movies, traveling, and going on hikes with friends and family. Also, I happened to grow up in [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai) and do speak `Marathi`, `Hindi`, `English`.
