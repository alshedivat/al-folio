I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Bocconi University, and a Visiting Graduate at University of California San Diego. I hold a MSc in Applied Economic Analysis from Stockholm School of Economics.

My research interests include environmental economics, health economics, development, and migration studies.



Currently based in San Diego.
