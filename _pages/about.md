 👋 Hello! I am a Grad student at [UT Austin (ECE-DICE)](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/). I Completed my Bachelors in AI, from [Amrita Vishwa Vidhyapeetham](https://amrita.edu/), Coimbatore.  I am fascinated by the power of modelling natural systems ever since I was introduced to Newton's Laws. I beleive that modelling systems gives us great power, which liberates us in some sense, to do what we intend to do with great conviction. So, here I am, on a quest to build intelligent systems that help us understand natural phenomenons and to push the frontiers of human  knowldege.

My research areas were largely, Graph Processing, Data-Driven Model Discovery and AI applications in Healthcare. I have authored several [publications](/publications) in these areas, under the mentorship of  [Dr. K.P. Soman](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=R_zpXOkAAAAJ&hl=en), during my undergrad. Currently, I am exploring methods to build trustworthy intelligent systems and causal AI.  I am equipped with a strong foundation of Linear Algebra , Optimization techniques and Signal Processing Techniques, which largely aids my exploration. 

I am an curious researcher , love writing, both technical or otherwise. In my free time I write poems in English and Tamizh, into Photography and Cricket as well.
