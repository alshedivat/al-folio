<b> ...a little about me</b> <br>
I am a master student of [Complex Adaptive Systems](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/Pages/Complex-Adaptive-Systems.aspx) at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. From summer 2023, I am an Erasmus+ exchange student to the [Physics of Fluids group](https://pof.tnw.utwente.nl/) at the University of Twente, Netherlands for my master's thesis work. I received my Bachelor degree in
[](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/)[Engineering Science](https://youtu.be/BcPO4yhWSUg), major in Engineering Physics at the University of Toronto, Canada. 

I am primarily interested in statistical physics and dynamical systems appraoches to fluid mechanics, computational physics, numerical and harmonic analysis, and their applications in oceanography and atmospheric science, as well as all the other fields in physics and mathematics. Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/RundongZhou_CV.pdf).

I'm currently working on my master thesis's project on understanding the fundamental processes of ocean turbulent mixing driven by near-inertial waves with [Dr. Chris Howland](https://chowland.github.io/) at the Physics of Fluids group. I use direct numerical simulations and analyze the experimental data with analytical tools of turbulence theory and statistical physics.

During my bachelor study, I worked with [Prof. Nicolas Grisouard](https://sites.physics.utoronto.ca/nicolasgrisouard) from the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto. My research project was on developing a [Fourier-Bessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier%E2%80%93Bessel_series) based spectral Laplacian solver in 2D polar coordinates for [Gross-Pitaevskii equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross%E2%80%93Pitaevskii_equation) which governs Bose–Einstein condensates. During the time, I also worked on discovering new types of discrete generalized Fourier methods using [Dini series](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiniExpansion.html) in polar coordinates with [Prof. Natalie Baddour](https://engineering.uottawa.ca/people/baddour-natalie) from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Ottawa. For more detailed introductions on my works, please click [here](/projects).

Out of academics, I am a wine and whisky enthusiast with the [WSET 3](https://www.wsetglobal.com/qualifications/wset-level-3-award-in-wines/) qualification. I also enjoy playing [DOTA2](https://www.dota2.com/home), I used to play competitively for team UofT at the 2018-2019 season [North America collegiate esports](https://playflyesports.com/spring-2023/) league.

...<b>a bit more on my name</b> <br>
In Chinese, last names are placed in the front, so my name actually goes as: 周 润东, with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin'>pīnyīn</a>: zhōu rùn/dōng. <br>And I always forgive people who don't speak Mandarin to pronounce it without the tones. :></font>
