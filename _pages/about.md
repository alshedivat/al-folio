I'm a data analyst, facilitator, and strategist. In my analysis work, I use Python, SQL, and Power BI to access, clean, transform, and visualize data into stories with the power to drive positive change. I believe grounding data work in intersectional feminist questions - about beneficence, bias, and positionality - is fundamental first step for those committed to using data for good. After all, the personal is political, and data work is both.

As a former poetry major, I know what it's like to evolve from someone who's adamantly "bad with numbers" to a coder. Anyone can be data literate, and every professional should be. In my last two roles, I've built successful data culture programs that fight the narrative that data work is for the small, super-smart few.
