Researcher with a strong foundation in Control and Automation Engineering from [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/) and a Master’s degree in Computer Science from [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin), experienced in Software-Defined Networking, Mobile/Wireless Communication, and Automation Systems in research and development activities at several organisations in academia and industry.

I am passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex engineering challenges and have worked on multiple interdisciplinary projects involving IoT, data-driven automation, and network optimization. My experience includes developing innovative solutions for optimizing infrastructure and enhancing the network performance on public and private networks.

With a deep understanding of both hardware and software components, I am adept at designing integrated systems that bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications, ensuring high performance and scalability in computer and communication networks. I do like to experiment web technologies irregularly and share my experiences on [xleap](https://xleap.pro).

Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:tanrmetn@gmail.com) if you have anything to discuss with.
