I am Mohammadhossein Malekpour. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with minor in Economics from the Amirkabir University of Technology, ranked among the top 3 universities in Iran. My last two-year GPA is 3.67/4.

During my bachelor's, I was a teaching assistant in six courses such as "Machine Learning", "Principles of Software Design", and "Applied Data Science". Moreover, I am currently working as a Data Analyst-Scientist and performing analysis on a wide variety of big data. 

My **research interest** sits at the intersection of data science, machine learning, deep learning, software engineering, MLOps, distributed systems, and big data. Since then, I have been actively reading papers in this area and found this field is what I would like to pursue in my graduate studies.
