Hi! I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at Columbia working on robotics and automation for biotechnology. My undergrad was in MechE at MIT where I got to work on several research projects spanning both biology and mechanical engineering, but now I mostly spend my time on learning how to build interesting robots. 

Outside of the shop you can find me running around central park or going to live music shows with friends. Running the Boston marathon is one of my big life dreams.
