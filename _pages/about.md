"I keep the subject constantly before me, and wait 'till the first dawnings open slowly, by little and little, into a full and clear light." -- Isaac Newton

I'm currently working with [Dr. Talia Ringer](https://dependenttyp.es) and [Dr. Christopher W. Fletcher](http://cwfletcher.net) on verifying security properties of [Oblivious RAM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivious_RAM). 


I love talking to people who are passionate about programming language design and verification, computer systems, meta theory, formal systems, computational geometry and entrepreneurship.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
