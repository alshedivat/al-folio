Telecommunication Engineer and Ph.D. specialist in Big Data and Signal Processing Technologies from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (both with honors). During my Ph.D., I researched the application of Signal Processing and Machine Learning to the Internet of Things (IoT), resulting in publications in respected international research journals. I have also lectured at undergraduate and graduate levels, both in Spanish and English, in courses such as Data Processing, Image Processing, and Signals and Systems. After the Ph.D., I served as a Postdoctoral Researcher at I3A (Instituto de Investigación en Ingeniería de Aragón), working on mathematical modeling of cardiac cells within the BSICoS (Biomedical Signal Interpretation and Computational Simulation) group.

Since 2019, I have been working as an Artificial Intelligence Engineer. I first joined NTT DATA (formerly Everis), where I coordinated the technical team responsible for the Artificial Intelligence components of Knowler, an innovative smart knowledge management system. I then continued my career at Plain Concepts as a Senior Data Scientist and AI Engineer, where I design, build, and deploy advanced AI and data-driven systems tailored to the needs of diverse clients, leveraging my expertise to deliver impactful solutions that help organizations extract value from their data.

I have professional experience in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and the design and implementation of intelligent information systems, including information extraction systems, document classifiers, and recommendation systems. I am proficient in Python and well-versed in technologies such as Azure, SQL, Elastic Search, and Big Data frameworks.

I have a strong interest in all levels of Research, Development, Innovation, and Competitive Intelligence, combining academic rigor with practical industry experience to navigate the evolving landscape of AI and technology.
