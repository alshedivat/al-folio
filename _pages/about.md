Software Engineer with a passion for solving business problems. 

I've been turning ideas into code commercially since 2018. During this time, I've had the privilege of working for amazing companies such as KOIOS Master Data, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and Flow Traders or working on side projects with friends.

My expertise lies in backend development, particularly Java. I thrive on leveraging my skills and creativity to tackle complex business challenges.

Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring on my bike, venturing to historical sites like castles, and capturing moments through photography.
