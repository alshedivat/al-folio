I am excited to introduce myself as a Data Scientist at Gilead Sciences, specializing in the deployment of state-of-the-art machine learning models to revolutionize clinical trial design and drug discovery processes. With a solid foundation in data science and a deep commitment to enhancing healthcare outcomes, I am fully dedicated to advancing Gilead's mission of pushing the boundaries of medical research and delivering innovative solutions to patients worldwide.

My educational journey includes completing a Bachelor's degree in Biosciences from Zhejiang University in 2017. Subsequently, I pursued a Ph.D. in Computational Biology and earned a master's degree in Computer Science from Rice University in 2023. My research interests encompass a broad spectrum of areas, including protein folding, molecular dynamics, deep learning, and various computational biology challenges.

Beyond the research, I like playing the piano, badminton, diving, plant identification, and traveling.
