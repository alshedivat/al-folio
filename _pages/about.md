I'm a PhD candidate in Computational Linguistics at Georgetown University, expecting to graduate in August 2021. [Nathan Schneider](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/) is my advisor, and I'm a member of [NERT](http://nert.georgetown.edu/) and [GUCL](http://gucl.georgetown.edu/).

My main research interest is evaluation of natural language generation, and I also enjoy corpus linguistics. Beyond research, I'm very interested in teaching, and in [communicating](https://lingcomm.org/) about linguistics and NLP to a broader audience!

You can see my CV [here](assets/pdf/CV.pdf).

### referring to me

I pronounce my name /ˈɛmə ˈmænɪŋ/. 

When referring to me with [third-person pronouns](https://kconrod.medium.com/pronouns-101-introduction-to-your-loved-ones-new-pronouns-3fef080266d0) in English, please use either they/them or he/him. If you're talking about me in a language other than English that marks gender grammatically, any non-feminine forms are fine.

As far as titles, I use the gender-neutral title 'Mx.' for now, though I hope to replace that soon with 'Dr.'
