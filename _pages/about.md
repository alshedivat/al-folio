As a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), I am currently working on three research projects in collaboration with Professors Robert E. Kass, Valérie Ventura, Larry Wasserman, Zhao Ren, Alessandro Rinaldo, and Arun Kuchibhotla. My research interests include spatiotemporal methods, graphical models, causal inference on time-series data, high-dimensional central limit theorem, and ranking from pairwise comparisons. For a list of my current and previous research topics, please visit my [projects](https://heejongbong.github.io/projects/) page.

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at CMU, where I was advised by Professors Robert E. Kass and Valérie Ventura. My doctoral thesis focused on developing and studying statistical methods for discovering communication across brain regions from neural recordings. I addressed the high-dimensional challenge using latent factor time-series and matrix-variate graphical models. During my Ph.D., I was fortunate to collaborate with Professor Alessandro Rinaldo on the theoretical consistency of ranking from pairwise comparisons.

I am excited to be joining the University of Michigan as a postdoctoral researcher, under the supervision of Professors Liza Levina and Ji Zhu, starting in the summer of 2023.
