I am a computer science student focused on quantum computing, earning my PhD at the University of California - Santa Cruz. I take a ''full stack'' approach to quantum computation: I enjoy working on high-level theoretical algorithms as well as breaking down pseudocode and circuits into gate implementations that can run efficiently on current quantum hardware. In particular, I enjoy finding speed-ups and efficiency enhancements to circuit implementations and unitary decompositions for near-term devices. I have worked on both time- and space-efficient quantum algorithms and think that even constant-size gains in performance help bring practical quantum computing to realistic scale.

Teaching has been an important part of my graduate school experience. I have taught multiple courses as a graduate instructor. One of my best skills is breaking down abstract problems to their bare components and building up complexity bit by bit. I believe in direct, simple communication and pride myself in my ability to connect with students, helping them work through difficult concepts. In Spring of 2023, I was awarded the Best TA Award of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

<!-- I spent the first years of my graduate career earning my masters in the [CS Theory](https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory) group at the University of Colorado Boulder. As an undergraduate, I studied mathematics at the [University of Denver](https://www.math.du.edu/) while also pursuing minors in computer science, physics, and psychology.  -->

Between school I worked as a software engineer at [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/nasdaq-financial-framework-nff) developing real-time risk management systems. I enjoyed my time working in software where I learned how to professionally code and learn modern software practices.
