After so many years sitting with *Meteorologist, geomorphologist, hydrologist, glaciologist, sedimentologist, geodesist, geologist, geophysicist*, **I am still none of them** 🤷‍♂️. But It's still a fantastic journey to [explore multidiscipline by using geodata](https://geo.w.uib.no/files/2020/01/Poster-The-Geological-Society-Geoscience-for-the-future-scaled.jpg), from discovering oil and gas to carbon capture and storage, from glacial mass balances to hydrological model, from the origin of landforms to permafrost projection at 2100.

This is spatial professional, sounds like can do everything but end up doing nothing 💊.
