This is Jafet Baca, an Economics enthusiast from Nicaragua and a first year Ph.D. student in Economics at Emory University, U.S.

I graduated *Magna Cum Laude* from Universidad Centroamericana (UCA-Nicaragua) in April 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Economics. 

My current academic interests are Macroeconomics and International Economics.
