I am a PhD student at the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. 
I work on computer vision and robotics to build useful robots in messy human environments (homes, hospitals) with [Prof. Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef). 

Prior to joining CMU, I graduated from McGill University, Canada, with a B.Sc. in Computer Science & Mathematics, where I worked on reinforcement learning with Profs. [Doina Precup](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/index.html) and [Joelle Pineau](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau). 
During the first two years of my PhD, I worked on ML applications for education with Prof. [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/). 
In 2020-2022, I took a leave from the PhD to build the ML/NLP product/team of an [early-stage data privacy startup](https://www.relyance.ai/).

In my spare time, I enjoy food and wine, traveling and nature, and lifting weights while listening to audio books. 
I grew up in Paris and my English accent has long been stuck at a local optimum.
