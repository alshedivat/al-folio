Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of collaborating with geologists, geophysicists, geomorphologists, hydrologists, glaciologist and other specialists, delving into the intricate world of geodata science; Even though I am still none of them right now 🤷‍♂️. 

As ~~a full stack geospatial professional~~ with a diverse range of skills, I experienced a fantastic journey from [discovering offshore oil](https://zhihaol.eu.org/projects/2020_q35/) to carbon capture and storage, from glacial mass balance to hydrological models, from examining [the origin of landforms](https://zhihaol.eu.org/blog/2022/Quaternary-geomorphology-of-Norway/) to predicting [permafrost changes at 2100](https://zhihaol.eu.org/blog/2022/permafrost-extent/). [All things are nested by geophysical data science!](https://i.imgur.com/wldOmMO.png) and geodata holds the key to uncovering hidden treasures...[If we know more about the variability of snow mass](https://zhihaol.eu.org/projects/2022_snowdepth/), the energy system will be more robust in hydropower production areas, such as Norway, Switzerland, Southwest China. Moreover, [if we have a more precise and bias-free climate observations & models](https://zhihaol.eu.org/projects/2023_downscaling/), we will cope with the uncertainties associated with climate-related risks and opportunities for energy, environment and society.
