I am an Assistant Professor at Abdullah Gül University,
 and my research interests include in-vehicle communication,
 cyber-physical systems security, embedded systems, and the internet
 of things. Additionally, I have a curiosity about precision farming.
 I teach courses that are related to embedded systems and programming.

I completed my postgraduate studies with a scholarship
 from the Turkish Ministry of Education. I earned my Ph.D. in 2022
 from Cranfield University, where I focused on the security
 of in-vehicle CAN communication. Before that, I completed my MSc in
 embedded systems engineering from the University of Leeds with distinction in 2016 and my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics engineering in 2013.
