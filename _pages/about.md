In 2018, I received the BSc degree in computer science from City University of Hong Kong. I am currently working toward the Phd degree at the City University of Hong Kong. My research interests include *applied cryptography*, *blockchain*, and *network security*. Notably, my thesis comprehensively studies the undergoing decentralized storage projects such as Filecoin and Chia, and proposes efficient zero knowledge auditing designs for blockchain-enabled validation.

In my leisure time, I enjoy exploring the following topics: *cognitive science*, *deep learning for NLP*, *cosmology*, *control theory*, *management science*, and history of science on general. 

My favourite game is *Capitalism II*.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
