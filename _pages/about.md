Hello! I'm Aswin, a Computer Science graduate with a keen interest in computer architecture, system software and compilers. I currently work as a Silicon Design Engineer 2 at AMD where I develop GEMM kernels for MI Instinct GPUs, and before this I was in the GPU Performance Verification team at Intel right after graduation. I'm based out of Bangalore and although don't have a lot of hobbies, but I enjoy riding my bike whenever I can and nerding out...

If you're interested in any of things that I am (or just want to have a random conversation), feel free to reach out to me through any of the socials listed below for a chat!
