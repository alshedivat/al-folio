I am a PhD candidate in Operations Management at [Desautels Faculty of Management](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/), [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca).

My research interests are in behavioural economics and sustainable operations, focusing on online fast fashion retail. I am interested in understanding how product variety affects consumer choices (variety-seeking vs. choice overload), and how fashion retailers can become more efficient at managing assortments and production quantities. I am also interested in studying the trade-offs that exist between the sunk cost of sustainable operations, increased consumer experience (in terms of willingness-to-pay), and increased quality of products put on the market, which would result in reduced consumption.
Consequently, I focus on **bridging theory and practice** by **developing data-driven modelling and optimization algorithms** for fashion retailers by combining consumer behaviour (e.g. context-effects), assortment and inventory optimization models, and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data.

I am motivated by addressing the **overproduction** and consequential societal issues the fast fashion industry created. In addition to putting immense pressure on the supply chain, **overproduction practices are creating a huge waste problem**.
My goal is therefore to **promote reduction of production** by more efficient management practices, and a transition to more sustainable operations.
Through my work, I am **contributing to GOAL 12** of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

For the next academic year, I will be visiting Rotterdam School of Management--Erasmus University where I will collaborate with Prof. Robert Rooderkerk!
