I am a **research scientist** working at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, neuroscience, and knowledge transfer.

My **background** is in programming, neuroimaging, numerical analysis, and systems modeling, with particular interest in neuroscience and computer vision. For more, take a look at my **<a href="/assets/pdf/CV_Notter.pdf">curriculum vitae</a>** or <a href="/publications">publications</a>.

I **am experienced** in working on challenging projects, both as a team member and project leader, collaborating with stakeholders from academia and industry and have a knack for quality, efficiency, and transparency. For more, check out my <a href="/background">background</a> and <a href="/projects">projects</a> page.


**My passion** for my work stems from a general curiosity and deep desire to understand complex systems, and the wish to keep up with the potential of and challenges around artificial intelligence. For more check out my <a href="/blog">blog</a> and <a href="/teaching">teaching</a>.
