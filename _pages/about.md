Hi! I am a second year master's student at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) , studying Quantitative Data Science Methods with a specialization in Machine Learning.

I am currently working part-time as a Research Assistant at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/), specifically within the [Perceiving Systems department](https://ps.is.mpg.de/) headed by [Dr. Michael Black](https://ps.is.mpg.de/person/black).
My research work here focuses on using combination of computer vision, machine learning and computer graphics to learn digital humans that can perceive, learn and act in virtual 3D worlds.\
My work here also involves working with the data team lead by [Tsvetelina Alexiadis](https://ps.is.mpg.de/person/talexiadis) where I work on data processing of the 3D captured datasets as well as software engineering tasks required to automate the processing and organizing the metadata related to it. 

I have had the privilege of holding various professional roles in the industry, including that of a Senior Software Engineer at [RackWare Inc](https://www.rackwareinc.com/).  Additionally, I have been fortunate to have had several internships at esteemed companies such as [Dell EMC](https://www.dell.com/in-en/blog/tags/dell-emc/), [Hasura Inc.](https://hasura.io) and RackWare Inc.

I am also part of [Association for Socially Applicable Research](https://www.asarforindia.org) where I work as a Data Analyst, which majorily involves streamlining data engineering pipelines such as importing, inspecting, cleaning and transforming a collection of medical datasets for data analysis and visualizations.

 In my spare, I like to play chess, go hiking and read books.
