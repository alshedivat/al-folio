I studied my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Statistics at Hong Kong Baptist University. Afterwards completed my Master's degree in Statistics with Data Science at the University of Edinburgh. After graduation, I worked as a research assistant in the <a href='https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/data-science-unit'>Data Science Unit</a> (DSU) for Science, Health, People and Environment (SHaPE) at the School of Informatics in the University of Edinburgh.

From a strong background in Mathematics so feel excited about learning and understanding new things in a mathematical way. I believe logic is essential for everything to be clear and tractable, which also makes programming a lot easier for me. Interested in all things of statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, covering a wide range of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. I don't just focus on theory but feel a responsibility to promote their use in cutting-edge researches and applications. \
*There is no end in learning but I'll keep going.*
