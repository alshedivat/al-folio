Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://bcs.mit.edu/) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) :brain:. I'm advised by [Earl Miller](https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu/earl-miller/) & [Ila Fiete](https://fietelab.mit.edu/), and I work closely with [Leo Kozachkov](https://kozleo.github.io/). I’m from Toronto, Canada, and did my undergraduate degree in [Applied Mathematics & Computer Engineering](https://engineering.queensu.ca/programs/undergraduate/mathematics-engineering.html) at [Queen’s University](https://www.queensu.ca/).

I'm interested in understanding consciousness and the nature of thought using dynamical systems theory and stability.

Aside from research, I love to write & play music :musical_keyboard:, hike and be active :mountain:, and cook :carrot: :fried_egg: :leafy_green:. If you're bored and looking for some music to listen to, I'm a writer and musician for my good pal [Erez Zobary](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7CIDRraBIHz8BenhnkJGnz?si=wid3gX6HTyaSejXmHSjX8Q).
