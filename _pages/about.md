The purpose of the PanExperiment Galactic Science Group is to gather expertise across all Cosmic Microwave Background experiments, provide a central hub to coordinate joint efforts across experiments and in collaboration with scientists studying the Milky Way.

Current focus
-------------

We currently have weekly telecons alternating between a Journal Club on Galactic Science and a meeting about the implementation of new Galactic models into [PySM 3](https://github.com/galsci/pysm).

How to join
-----------

So far the leadership in the ACT, BICEP/Keck, BLAST, CCAT-prime, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, SO, and SPT collaborations have endorsed membership in the GS Pan-Experiment Group, but we hope to grow to include other CMB experiments. We are now also accepting members from the ISM community who are not affiliated with any CMB experiments.
