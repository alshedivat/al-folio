I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). My current research consists of three projects, in collaboration with Professors Robert E. Kass, Valérie Ventura, Larry Wasserman, Zhao Ren, Alessandro Rinaldo, and Arun Kuchibhotla. Please see the [projects](https://heejongbong.github.io/projects/) page for the current and previous research topics. I am on the 2022-23 job market and looking for faculty and postdoctoral positions. 

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics at CMU, advised by Professors Robert E. Kass and Valérie Ventura. My doctoral thesis developed and studied statistical methods of discovering communication across brain regions from neural recordings. I solved the high-dimensional challenge with latent factor time-series and matrix-variate Graphical models. Alongside the thesis, I was fortunate to collaborate with Professor Alessandro Rinaldo on the theoretical consistency of ranking from pairwise comparisons.

My research interests include spatiotemporal methods, graphical models, causal inference on time-series data, high-dimensional central limit theorem, and ranking from pairwise comparisons.
