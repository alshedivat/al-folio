I am a research scientist at <a href="https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/conversational-ai-natural-language-processing">Amazon Alexa AI</a> in Sunnyvale, where I work on conversational AI and natural language understanding.

At Amazon I've worked on <a href="https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/socialbot-grand-challenge">Alexa Prize SocialBot</a> with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w90wOucAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Yang Liu</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GMcL_9kAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Dilek Hakkani-Tur</a>, and <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-alexa-generative-ai">building new Alexa LLM</a>. Previously, I received dual undergraduate degrees in Sociology and Economics from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, where I did my thesis with <a href="http://www.shehui.pku.edu.cn/sz/content.aspx?nodeid=72">Prof. Jianxin Li</a>. Then I did my Masters in Statistics at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~hseltman/AboutMe.html">Prof. Howard Seltman</a>.

I work primarily on conversational AI, particularly building and evaluating open-domain dialogue systems. My research interests include socially-aware NLP with social commonsense reasoning, large language models, and AI for social good. I am also broadly interested in AI alignment, responsible AI, and human-centered NLP. 

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, photography, playing badminton and volleyball, and screenwriting. In 2021, I co-founded <a href="https://www.startfilmstudio.org/home">STArt Film Studio</a> with friends in Seattle, and wrote my <a href="https://www.startfilmstudio.org/film-projects#h.4c6r5ada2ogv">first short film</a> which was nominated for the Award at Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF) 2022.
