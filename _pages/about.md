I am a 2nd year [Computer Science PhD student](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/njain17) at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/), working on ML research in [Professor Tom Goldstein's](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/) Lab. My research interests are in various NLP, including fast adapations of exsiting models, interpretability, and reliability. 

Prior to UMD, I graduated from [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/) in 2019 with Honors in Mathematics. At Williams, I wrote my thesis on graph theory under [Professor Pamela Harris](https://www.pamelaeharris.com/), which lead to a publication in Graphs and Combinatorics. After Williams, I worked as a Data Scientist for [Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.boozallen.com/), where I worked on projects of various topics including math modeling and machine learning.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, playing sports, cooking, baking, and board games.
