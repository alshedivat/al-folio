Hi, 

I am Amir Pourmand (امیر پورمند - in Farsi). Currently, I'm pursuing my masters in `AI & Robotics` at Sharif University of Technology under supervision of [Prof. Hamid R. Rabiee](http://sharif.edu/~rabiee/){:target="\_blank"}. 

As a member of `Digital Media Laboratory`, I'm working on "automatic realtime polyp detection and clasification using XAI". 

I've also studied computer engineering at Yazd University. 

I've worked as `software developer` in Amapardazesh company from ... to ... . That's why I know a lot about clean coding, software architectures and also amazing tools like git. 

For my daily usage, I prefer to use GNU-Linux based OS like Kubuntu (KDE + Ubuntu). I love [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software){:target="\_blank"} and this is the main reason I migrated from windows to GNU-Linux. I'd love to call myself `computer geek`.
