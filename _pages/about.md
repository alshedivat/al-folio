As a Senior Data Scientist in Novo Nordisk, my goal is to find genetic predictors of disease that are useful for diagnosis, treatment, and understanding the underlying biology. To that end, I use machine learning to assist with modeling, biomarker discovery and variant interpretation.

I received my PhD from [MINES ParisTech](www.mines-paristech.fr), in Paris, France, under the supervision of [Chloé-Agathe Azencott](https://cazencott.info/). In my thesis I explored graph-based methods for genetic studies. Afterwards, I was accepted in [RIKEN's](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) [SPDR program](https://www.riken.jp/en/careers/programs/spdr/) to conduct my postdoctoral research with [Makoto Yamada](https://www.oist.jp/research/makoto-yamada). I focused on the development and application of novel machine learning methods.
