I am a fifth year PhD student at the [Paul Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at University of Washington supervised by [Sara Mostafavi](http://saramostafavi.github.io). Before my PhD, I earned BSs in Biology and Computer Science from Peking University. During my undergraduate, I did some bioinformatics research at [Gao Lab](http://www.gao-lab.org/index.php/en/home/). Please see my [CV](https://xinmingtu.cn/cv/) for more information.

My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and scientific discovery. I am passionate about building **AI Co-Scientists**—autonomous agents that can accelerate the pace of scientific research. My motivation stems from a fundamental belief: as we approach AGI, the bottleneck in science will shift from solving individual problems to building systems that can navigate open-ended discovery itself.

My work spans two interconnected directions. First, I continue to advance **AI for Regulatory Genomics**, including sequence-to-function frameworks, multi-omics representation, and perturbation modeling under single-cell context—but now through the lens of agentic systems that can autonomously design and execute genomics experiments. Second, I am expanding toward **AI for General Science Discovery**, developing LLM-based agents that can reason, experiment, and discover across diverse scientific domains. My goal is to compress what currently takes researchers months or years into days, ultimately accelerating the arrival of the AI Scientist itself.
