Dr. Ka Chung Ng, Boris, is an Assistant Professor - Presidential Young Scholar in the Department of Management and Marketing, Faculty of Business, Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He received his Ph.D. in Information Systems from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

His works bridge multidisciplinary research areas and advanced machine learning methods to resolve significant societal issues and generate valuable business insights.

<strong>Currently, I am working on projects that advance the theory and practice of FinTech, RegTech, and LegalTech. Motivated and intelligent students are welcome to join my group as research student helpers, research assistants, postdoctoral researchers, or Ph.D. students. Candidates with a strong background in Information Systems, Computer Science, Statistics, and/or Mathematics are preferred.
