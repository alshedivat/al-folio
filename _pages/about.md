*Hi folks!*  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="20px">

My name is Evan Febrianto and I am a tech-addict.

👨‍💻 I'm a huge fan of integrating new technologies into a variety of different fields. I enjoy developing tiny projects that explain or demonstrate how to use programs in our daily life. I am currently working as a Computer Vision and Robotics Lead at CAD-IT Consultants, where I am responsible for leading a medium-sized team and conducting research into cutting-edge technologies.

🎓 In college, I majored in electrical engineering. Since my freshman year at college, I've been a member of the robotics club. My autonomous mobile soccer robots have helped me win multiple national competitions. More and more, as my knowledge of robotics and programming grows, the more certain I get that I can make a difference in the world.

✨ My interests in robotics and computer vision are piqued. Creating new and helpful technology by fusing software and hardware is one of my favorite hobbies. It's incredible. My areas of expertise are problem solving, time management, and acquiring new skills and programming languages quickly. As of right now, I'm proficient in the following languages: C/C++/Python/JavaScript/CSS/Pascal. As time progresses, I'm sure I'll be able to learn more.

📌 If you'd like to discuss computer vision or robotics with me, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
