Hello! I'm Bryan Lu, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences studying mathematics and computer science at Cornell University. My interests are currently split across combinatorics and programming languages, but I also like to be literate in a variety of other fields, including physics and linguistics.  

I also think a lot about pedagogy and communication in math, and how to bridge the gap between intuitive reasoning and rigorous, formal reasoning. I help grade for the MATH 2230/MATH 2240 sequence at Cornell, which gives first-year students a rigorous understanding of linear algebra and multivariable calculus (alongside exposure to many other mathematical disciplines, including real analysis and differential geometry) while also giving them training and practice in writing proofs. 

In other things, I dance a lot and I'm currently the performance director for the Assorted Aces, a beginner-oriented dance group on campus. I also am on the executive board for Cornell Dancers' Alliance, supporting dance teams on campus and holding events that bring the dance community at Cornell together. Other interests include karate, ultimate frisbee, and puzzle hunts.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
