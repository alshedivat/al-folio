I'm often asked about how I went from history to accounting to data science - I have degrees in all of these - and the answer is a lot more straightforward than a lot of people expect. 
We are surrounded by data. It's in pictures and symbols, books, videos, financial reports, and countless other sources. Everything we do, understand, and experience is informed by data. All I did was go from a manual version of text processing (history) to numeric data (accounting) to being able to quickly process both (data science). I've always been interested in how and why things happen, because if you don't understand how or why something occurred, how can you possibly learn from that? But most people don't understand the skills that are learned there (research methodology, critical thinking, analysis and argumentation, written and verbal communication, etc.) so I got a degree in accounting, which allowed people to feel comfortable pretending they understood my skill set. Accounting, especially audit, which I have a soft spot for, is extremely interesting, but also often includes a lot of uncessesarily tedious processes. There are so many things that can be automated and presented differently so consumers of financial data can more readily understand what they're looking at and see where problems might arise (or in the case of fraud, already occured and more readily singled out and remedied). Data science seemed to be one answer to that problem. Data science is automation, history, accounting, and so many more kinds of data processing all in one. It's a technical methodology of understanding the world, or at least one specific part of the world.

In my free time I enjoy acro, weightlifting, yoga, running, reading, and volunteering with [Tech Journey](https://www.techjourney.org/). I'm also an ISSA certified run coach. I live in Iowa with my husband, two alien dogs in cat suits, and one dog who has mostly figured out how to be a dog.
