I am a **Researcher** in the Cognitive Computing Lab at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) working with [Dr. Ping Li](http://research.baidu.com/People/index-view?id=111) on generative modeling and its practical applications (e.g., Information Retrieval and AI Security). Previously, I was at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/)/[Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/) ([Prof. Chandan K. Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/reddy)) &#10229; [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/) ([Dr. Sathiya Keerthi Selvaraj](http://www.keerthis.com/) and Dr. Fengjiao Wang)  &#10229; [UMCP](https://www.cs.umd.edu/)/[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard). More about me **[HERE](/bio)** and my professional/academic services **[HERE](/bio#services)**.

I'm looking for <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red">motivated research interns/assistants</span> in Vietnam (and potentially other Asian countries), working on <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red">Robust ML</span> (e.g., adversarial robustness, backdoor/poisoning attacks, & OOD/generalization robustness), <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red">Generative Models</span> (e.g., energy-based generative models and diffusion models), and <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red">Low-resource NLP</span> (e.g., translation & summarization). Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7O3-3HmcNlZMQM5OnBZP0jygQMIXVM0ooGQulo6KSCN2dpg/viewform">fill out this form</a> if you are interested!

<h5><a href="/bio" style="color:black;">{{"Research Interests"}}</a></h5>
My research seeks answers to the following question: *How to make ML models simpler & reliable to use in constrained settings*? I am interested in developing computational frameworks that enable existing complex/deep models to be more suitable for practical uses. I focus on improving the following aspects of existing models: (i) **training/inference**, (ii) **realistic assumptions**, (iii) **algorithmic robustness**, and (iv) **efficiency in constrained settings**. Most of my ML/AI solutions center around generative-based approaches that have low computational complexity and require less human effort. More about my research interests **[HERE](/bio#research_interests)**.
