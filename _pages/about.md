Hello There!
I am Saikumar Yadugiri.
You can call me Sai (pronounced po-**sai**-don :trident:).
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [computer science department](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
I am currently working with [Prof. Rishab Goyal](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~rishab/) on various flavors of functional encryption.
I am broadly interested in the theoretical aspects of classical and (post-)quantum cryptography.

Previously, I was a student in the [computer science department](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu) at the University of California, Santa Barbara pursuing my master's degree in computer science.
I worked with [Prof. Prabhanjan Ananth](https://sites.google.com/site/prabhanjanva) for my master's thesis requirement, in which we utilized functional encryption to eliminate interaction in the private set intersection problem.

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in) from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras(IIT Madras).
I have been immensely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shweta Agrawal](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~shwetaag/) for my Bachelor's thesis on recognizing and applying blockchain-based solutions to various everyday scenarios.
My thesis was part of the preliminary phase 1 of [National Blockchain Project](https://blockchain.cse.iitk.ac.in).

I was also gainfully employed at Oracle R&D in Bengaluru, India as a software development engineer working on Oracle Cloud Database solutions.
