My research draws on insights from behavioral economics and employs
econometrics, field-, and lab-in-the-field experiments to examine a variety of
topics in development economics <br> <br>
I also think a lot about heterogeneity: how it
shapes the success and optimal design of public policy, and how heterogeneous
returns affect individual decision-making
