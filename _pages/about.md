I am a research scientist working at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, neuroscience, and knowledge transfer. I have strong scientific, analytical, teaching, and interpersonal skills, and experience working on challenging projects, both as a team member and project leader, collaborating with stakeholders from academia and industry. My background is in programming, numerical analysis, and systems modeling, with particular interest in the medical field and computer vision. I enjoy working in a stimulating and vibrant environment and have a knack for quality, efficiency, and transparency. My passion for my work stems from a general curiosity and deep desire to understand complex systems, and the wish to keep up with the potential of artificial intelligence.
