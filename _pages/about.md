I am current working at the Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering at Aarhus University, Denmark.

My research has been conducted in both the wet and dry labs using traditional microbiological methods, multi-omics approaches, bioinformatic analysis, and enzymology to reveal and characterize, microorganisms, microbiomes, enzymes, and metabolic pathways involved in  degradation of complex polymers (e.g., lignocellulose, lignin, and plastic).

More recently, I have taken on a new challenge to investigate at the holo-omics level the adaptation of animals to imposed restricted diets with the aim of exploring their holistic microbial community dynamics for complex polymer conversion, following the study of enzymes secreted and metabolic pathways involved.
How do I do that?  Combining comparative genomic, metagenome, metaproteome, and metabolome, I reveal the enzymes and metabolic pathways involved in all metabolic processes at the symbiotic level.
By doing so, this information is translated into sustainable and effective strategies for biochemical products and enzyme production using synthetic biology.
