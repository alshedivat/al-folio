I'm a PhD student at the [Scalable Parallel Computing Laboratory](http://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/)
at the [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch),
advised by [Prof. Torsten Hoefler](http://unixer.de/).
My main research goal is to develop **high-performance solutions for
the new cloud paradigm of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)** computing.
The _serverless_ revolution brings new elastic and flexible resource allocation techniques,
and combined with a high-performance programming model, it will open new opportunities to increase
resource utilization and decrease monetary and environmental costs in data centers of all sizes.

I obtained my Master's degree in Simulation Sciences from the [RWTH Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/) (Germany)
where I worked on my Master thesis in the [HPAC Group](https://hpac.cs.umu.se/), supervised by
[Prof. Paolo Bientinesi](https://hpac.cs.umu.se/~pauldj/) and [Prof. Benjamin Berkels](https://www.aices.rwth-aachen.de/en/people/berkels).
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the
[Silesian University of Technology](https://www.polsl.pl/en/Pages/Welcome.aspx) in Poland,
where I had the opportunity to work at the [Institute of Theoretical and Applied Informatics, Polish Academy of Sciences](https://www.iitis.pl/en)
with [Prof. Tadeusz Czachórski](https://www.iitis.pl/pl/person/tczachorski), Dr Artur Rataj,
and [Dr Mateusz Nowak](https://www.iitis.pl/en/person/mnowak).
