I am a PhD student in the department of [Computer Science at Cambridge University](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) and I am part of the [Natural Language and Information Processing Research Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/). I am working on Natural Language Processing with Prof [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/). In particular, I am currently interested in parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning of large pretrained language models (keywords: few-shot learning, meta-learning, active-learning).
