### About me

Currently I am a PhD Student in Economics at [Columbia University](https://econ.columbia.edu/). In the Summer of 2023 I will join [Golub Capital Social Impact Lab](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/labs-initiatives/sil) at Stanford GSB as a Postdoctoral	Scholar.

Previously I studied at [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/economics) and was a Visiting Researcher at [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/).      

My research interests include Industrial Organization, Public Economics, Bayesian Statistics and Natural Language Processing.
