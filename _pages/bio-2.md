In 2010, I joined Istanbul Technical University [ITU](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en), where I studied Control and Automation Engineering and worked in Istanbul. In 2016, I moved to Berlin for further education at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/), while also working at the [Fraunhofer Institute](https://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/) until 2021, where I contributed to various research projects.

Since 2021, I’ve worked with various startups and institutions, further honing my expertise in cloud technologies, security, data-driven development, and scalable architecture and infrastructure automation. With a solid foundation in engineering, research, and hands-on experience in diverse environments, I am continually focused on leveraging technology to solve complex challenges and drive innovation - and trying to make the most of it 👇.
