Music is woven into my existence, enhancing every moment. At work, it fuels my creativity and helps me find innovative solutions. When I unwind, it helps me relax and connect with my inner self. It's the soundtrack to my life, the universal language that speaks to my soul. I do also drop some beats occasionally. You can check my adventurous collection [here](https://soundcloud.com/abraxast) and recently [here](https://xwing.space). Reposts are sets and likes are single tracks - gave my years into it, don't get lost. 🎛️
