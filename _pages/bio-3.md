I've been active in sports since a young age, always eager to try something new—from team games to solo challenges. Over the years, this passion has shaped both my mindset and lifestyle.

I also have a very eclectic and interesting taste in music, which you can explore [here](https://soundcloud.com/abraxast). 🏃🏻☀️
