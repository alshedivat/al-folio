Currently, I am serving as a postdoctoral research fellow within the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Under the guidance of Professors Liza Levina and Ji Zhu, my current research pursuits problems related to causal inference on networks. My prior research interests have included spatiotemporal methods, graphical models, causal inference on time-series data, high-dimensional central limit theorem, and ranking from pairwise comparisons. For a comprehensive overview of my ongoing and prior research endeavors, I invite you to peruse the details outlined on my dedicated [projects](/projects/) page.

In a recent milestone, I attained my Ph.D. in Statistics from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), under guidance of Professors Robert E. Kass and Valérie Ventura. my doctoral research revolved around the innovation and rigorous examination of statistical methodologies. These methodologies were specifically tailored for the task of uncovering communication among brain regions, drawing insights from intricate neural recordings. To surmount the intricacies posed by high-dimensional data, I pioneered the integration of latent factor time-series techniques and matrix-variate graphical models. Subsequent to the successful completion of my Ph.D., I spent a productive year as a postdoctoral researcher in the same department. This year proved to be a rich period of collaboration, involving joint ventures with a constellation of accomplished scholars. Notably, I had the privilege to collaborate on three impactful research projects with Professors Robert E. Kass, Valérie Ventura, Larry Wasserman, Zhao Ren, Alessandro Rinaldo, and Arun Kuchibhotla.
