<ins>__Abstract__</ins> : Financial recessions are typically characterized by a large risk premium and a slow recovery. However, macro-finance models have trouble quantitatively explaining these empirical features, especially when they are calibrated to simultaneously match both the observed unconditional and conditional macroeconomic and asset pricing moments. In this paper, I build a macro-finance model that quantitatively explains the salient features of a financial crisis, such as a large drop in output, a spike in the risk premium, reduced financial intermediation, and a long duration of economic distress. The model has leveraged intermediaries with stochastic productivity and a state-dependent exit rate that governs the transition into and out of a crisis. A model without these two features suffers from a trade-off between the amplification and persistence of crisis. I show that my model resolves this tension and generates realistic crisis dynamics.
