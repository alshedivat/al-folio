        <b>ACM SIGSPATIAL 2022 (11/01/2022 -- 11/04/2022)</b> <br><br>
        From November 1st to 4th, 2022, I attended the 30th ACM SIGSPATIAL in Seattle, WA. I presented our paper <b>TrafficAdaptor: An Adaptive Obfuscation Strategy for Vehicle Location Privacy Against Vehicle Traffic Flow Aware Attacks</b>. <br>
        It was great to know many excellent researchers in the area of spatial computing!

        <b>NSF SaTC PI Meeting 2022 (06/01/2022 -- 06/02/2022)</b> <br><br>
        On June 1st and June 2, 2022, I attended the NSF SaTC PI Meeting in Washington, D.C. I presented some of the research progress made in our current SaTC project  <b>Privacy protection of Vehicles location in Spatial Crowdsourcing under realistic adversarial models</b> during the poster session. <br>
        It was great to have many exciting discussions with other researchers about data privacy, the security of AI, and cybersecurity!
