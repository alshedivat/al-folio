## Research Positions 

Feel free to contact [our faculty members](/people/). 

We will post our currently open positions here as soon as they become available. More are on the way!

## Ph.D Positions

We are looking for motivated PhD students to work in the area of theoretical and computational fusion plasma physics. These positions are fully funded and will be hosted in School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Please contact [our faculty members](/people/) if you are interested. 

Our main research area includes
- Accelerating wave and turbulence calculations
- Finding the optimal design of fusion devices
- Interpreting and compressing simulation/experimental data

Some of our projects are listed [here](/projects/). But please feel free to propose whatever you are interested in.

Applicants are expected to hold a Bachelor’s/Master’s degree in a related field by the time they start their PhD. Experience in one the following is desirable but not essential:
- Coursework or research undertaken in plasma physics.
- Running a high-performance supercomputer code, especially for fusion plasma physics.
- Using a modern machine learning software.

Please refer to the following websites for the minimum requirements and application guidelines of SPMS and NTU.
