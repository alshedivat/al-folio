Thank you for your interest in working with me. I receive a fair number of inquiries from prospective students every week, and have put together this page to provide more information.

  We seek students from all backgrounds.

If you are an architect or urban designer, we will teach you data/technical skills to effectively apply your knowledge to promote sustainable decision-making in your community. If you are a coder or technical student in urbanism and planning, we will teach you how to use your skills for more sustainable cities.

You can start working with me in a number of ways, depending on whether you are a Georgia Tech (GT) student or external to GT.

### External to GT

If you are external to GT, and would like to join GT to work with me, I would encourage you to either apply for the [M.S. in Architecture](https://arch.gatech.edu/master-science-architecture) or the [Ph.D. in Architecture](https://arch.gatech.edu/phd-architecture). _Please note that admission decisions are made by an admissions comittee_ and not by myself. I personally _cannot_ admit your to one of our programs.

Before submitting an official GT application, you are welcome to reach out to me beforehand to make sure there is a fit. Instead of approaching me with a cover letter, please use [this form](https://forms.gle/YGa9cNqTumaREhF16) to get in touch with me.

### Student at GT

If you are a current student at Georgia Tech and would like to join my group, I ask you to complete one semester as part of my [Vertically Integrated Project (VIP)](/teaching/gt-vip-vyh/).

Please refer to the official VIP program information on how to join my VIP as an [undergraduate](https://vip.gatech.edu/apply-undergraduate-students) or [grad student](https://vip.gatech.edu/graduate-students). There are options to join the class as 1-3 credit hours, depending on your level of seniority at GT.
