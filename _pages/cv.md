A curriculum vitae dated July 13th, 2022 is [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/pdf/ShiwaliMohanCV.pdf %}) and a [one-page resume]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/pdf/ShiwaliMohanResume.pdf %}) also dated July 13th, 2022.

My [research statement]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link /assets/pdf/ResearchStatement.pdf %}) provides a gentle introduction to a research agenda for collaborative human-AI systems and discusses a few real-world problems that necessitate an inter-disciplinary approach. [Humans of AI]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link /assets/pdf/humans_of_ai.pdf %}) presents the same information in a different format.

I am committed to [diversity in science and technology]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link /assets/pdf/DiversityStatement.pdf %}).
