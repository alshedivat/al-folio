In 2021-2022, I had fun preparing and teaching the exercise sessions of [Machine Learning for Physicists](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/machine-learning-for-physicists-PHYS-467) (taught by Prof. Lenka Zdeborova) and teaching PyTorch and deep learning foundations as an introduction to research for Master's projects in deep learning theory.

In 2022-2023, I'm teaching the exercise sessions of the second edition of [Machine Learning for Physicists](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/machine-learning-for-physicists-PHYS-467).
