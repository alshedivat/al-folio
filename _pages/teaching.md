### Lab course “Memory Technology 1&2"
*TU Dresden & NaMLab, 2022-2023*

Tutor for the lab sessions of the graduate course Memory Technology 1&2. During the course, the students perform on-wafer measurements on memory devices using a probe station, SMUs and AWGs. 
The first session covers the programming and reading operations of embedded floating gate transistors from a commercial CMOS node. The secound course deals with fundamental characterization techniques for lab-fabricated ferroelectric capacitors like dynamic hysteresis, PUND and access time measurements.

### Lab course “Micro- and Nanoelectronics"
*RWTH Aachen, 2020*

Student tutor for two lab sessions of the lab course "Micro- and Nanoelectronics". The first session covers packaging of semiconductor devices via wire bonding and flip chip.The studentes then continue to evaluate the resulting contact resistance via 4-point measurements. The second session covers the characterization of a commercial operational amplifier, where the students verify datasheet figures like gain-bandwidth product and slew rate with their own measurements.

### Tutorial “Fundamentals of electronic materials and devices”
*RWTH Aachen, 2019*

Student tutor for the lecture “Fundamentals of electronic materials and devices 1”.
Assisting small groups of students with tutorials covering fundamentals of semiconductor physics and device fundamentals, such as conduction mechanisms, semiconductor band structures, field effect structures and metal-semiconductor interfaces.
