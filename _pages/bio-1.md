I had the 'privilege' (or maybe 'curse,' depending on who you ask) of traveling all over Turkey with my parents and brother. We moved from the far southeast to the northwest, hitting up seven different cities by the time I was 14—spending about two years in each place. My childhood memories mostly consist of trucks and the never-ending cycle of packing and unpacking our stuff. At 14, I was selected as 4th out of 50,000 candidates after stages to join [Kuleli Military High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuleli_Military_High_School), along with pilot training at the [Turkish Air Forces](https://hho.msu.edu.tr/Eng_default.aspx) where I had a chance to fly Cessna 172s for several sorties. ✈️
