### Philosophy

Articles
- ["The Revolt of the Salaried Bourgeoisie"](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v34/n02/slavoj-zizek/the-revolt-of-the-salaried-bourgeoisie){:target="_blank"}, Slavoj Žižek -- an important update to Marxist analysis for the 21st century economy, especially for tech workers
- ["Philosophy: Who Needs It?"](https://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Philosophy-Who-Needs-It-text.pdf){:target="_blank"}, Ayn Rand -- a rhetorically effective and accessible explanation for why philosophy is more important than ever, which I recommend to anyone who is skeptical of or new to philosophy
- ["Rawls' Law of Peoples: Rules for a Vanished Westphalian World"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/233370){:target="_blank"}, Allen Buchanan -- an interesting philosophical historicization of Rawls which strikes at a deep gash in political philosophy itself.
- ["Rawls, Hegel, and Communitarianism"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/192057){:target="_blank"}, Sibyl A. Schwarzenbach -- an interesting attempt at the very difficult project of writing coherently on Rawls and Hegel in the same paragraph.
<!-- - ["The Ethical Significance of Nationality"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2380889){:target="_blank"}, David Miller -- what I would call (no doubt with controversy) a proto-phenomenological approach to political philosophy: a return to the Delphic motto, "know thyself!" -->
- ["Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3178066){:target="_blank"}, Donna Haraway -- great and nuanced discussion of object(ivity) and the subject, employing the vision metaphor
- ["Epistemologies of Ignorance"](https://kwanj.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/alcoff-epistemologies-of-ignorance-three-types.pdf){:target="_blank"}, Linda Alcoff -- interesting synthesis of thinkers on ignorance

Books
- *The Poverty of Ethics*, Anat Amar -- a brilliant synthesis of analytic ethics and Continental discontent.
- *Queer Phenomenology*, Sara Ahmed -- a phenomenological account of queer bodies and spaces which leads us towards a socially-aware phenomenology of phenomenology
- *Sex and the Failed Absolute*, Slavoj Zizek -- an ingenious and culturally aware synthesis of psycholanalysis and Hegel, through a triadic topological analogy
<!-- - *Being and Nothingness*, Jean-Paul Sartre -- the classic existentialist text; a wonderful medium for self-reflection and meditation -->

---

### Film
Movies
- *Oppenheimer* -- the most powerful film I have experienced. More horrific than any horror movie I have watched. Exploration of the utter contradiction of man and God, of violence and peace, of necessity and freedom -- of the atomic bomb and Oppenheimer.
- *Summer of '85* -- a more sensitive and textually self-aware *Call Me By Your Name*
- *Brokeback Mountain* -- a classic masterpiece of environmental cinematography and queer film
- *La La Land* -- beautiful cinematography and play with destiny and time
- *Parasite* -- biting social critique of globalized capitalism
- *2001: A Space Odyssey* -- an unhurried and thoughtful meditation on technology and Nietzschian transcendence
- *The Menu* -- an entertaining watch and commentary on bourgeois consumption and production
- *Midsommar* -- a beautiful film, and a deeply disturbing exploration of the "anthropologist's gaze"

TV Shows
- *Succession* -- an edgy portrayal of family, politics, and corporate power
- *The White Lotus* -- brilliantly nuanced portrays of colonial, racial, and sexual tensions in bourgeois society

Documentary
- *Hearts and Minds* -- a brutally material portrayal of horror and patriotism in the Vietnam War, terrifying in its nakedness
- *The Pervert's Guide to Ideology* -- a fun watch, an accessible overview of Slavoj Zizek's psychoanalytic-Hegelian treatment of cinema
- *AlphaGo* -- a close look at humanity from the nonhuman: indeed, the only perspective from which humanity can truly be gazed at.

### Fiction
- *Crime and Punishment*, Fyodor Dostevsky -- a meditation on sin, guilt, and redemption
- *Infinite Jest*, David Foster Wallace -- we are addicted to entertainment, and entertained by addiction
- *Never Let Me Go*, Kazuo Ishiguro -- the beauty of our fragile life becomes palpable when it's about to be broken
- *Lolita*, Vladimir Nabokov
