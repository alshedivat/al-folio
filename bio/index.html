        I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science, <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/coe/">Edward E. Whitacre
        Jr.
        College of Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.ttu.edu/">Texas
        Tech University</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://idatavisualizationlab.github.io/">interactive Data
        Visualization Lab (iDVL)</a>, where I work with Dr.
        Tommy Dang.<br><br>
        I do research in interactive data visualization (vis), visual analytics and human-computer interaction. I
        develop web-based interactive vis using D3.js, supporting the understanding and insight discovery of
        quantitative and qualitative data. I'm learning to build a template for event detection mechanisms in
        visualizing time-series data.

                <p>Before pursuing the PhD program at Texas Tech, I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems
                    at <a href="https://en.hust.edu.vn/">Hanoi University of
                        Science and Technology</a> (Đại học Bách Khoa Hà Nội), Vietnam, in 2018. I worked with Dr. Oanh
                    Nguyen in the Knowledge and Data Engineering Lab (now known as Data Science Lab) on problems in
                    computer vision such as object detection and object proposal generation.</p>

                <p>I got interested in image processing after attending Dr. Nguyen's Multimedia Database Systems class
                    in 2017 and started working with her since. The first topic that got me hooked was keypoint
                    extraction using SIFT, implemented with <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV library</a>. We then
                    reviewed superpixelation and selective search methods for object segmentation proposals, inspired by
                    <a href="http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~jkannala/publications/cvpr2014a.pdf">Rantalankila et al.</a>'s paper
                    on generating proposals using global and local search.

                    Towards my graduation, we moved on with deep learning techniques using convolutional neural networks
                    for multi-label image classification. I completed my final thesis on training an object detection
                    model with transfer learning using MobileNetv2 with TensorFlow on a general collection of images.

                    I spent the summer of 2016 working as a Big Data Engineer Intern at VC Corp, Hanoi. I worked with
                    Apache Hadoop in handling distributed storage for big data using HDFS and processing data using
                    Map-Reduce programming model. I participated in the anomaly detection project using K-means
                    clustering to detect outliers in the system activities log data.
