This is an example post with some pseudo code rendered by [pseudocode](https://github.com/SaswatPadhi/pseudocode.js). The example presented here is the same as the one in the [pseudocode.js](https://saswat.padhi.me/pseudocode.js/) documentation, with only one simple but important change: everytime you would use `$`, you should use `$$` instead. Also, note that the `pseudocode` key in the front matter is set to `true` to enable the rendering of pseudo code. As an example, using this code:
