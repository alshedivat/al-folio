I am passionate about highly collaborative projects and research that impact high-stake real-world problem settings at the intersection of medicine, environmental change, and human behavior through artificial intelligence and machine learning.

In this context I am interested in methods from multi-modal learning, network analysis, and exceptional model mining to Bayesian modeling, deep learning, representation learning, explainable AI, and human computer interaction.

My publications and projects, please refer to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n99pDOAAAAAJ&hl=en) and my [lab page](/).
