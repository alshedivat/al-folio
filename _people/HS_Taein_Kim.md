**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**About Me:**
My name is Taein, a sophomore at TJHSST. I have various interests and activities, which include but are not limited to math, biology, and computer science. I participate in the varsity math team and senior computer team in school; for extracurriculars, I am a part of the school marching band.

**Project/Research Interests:**
In the EDIT program, my primary research interest is on machine learning; I have some experience in back-end programming and devising algorithms. I would love to research how this algorithm theory applies to real life such as in the clinical trials that EDIT conducts.
