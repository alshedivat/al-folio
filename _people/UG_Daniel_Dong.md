**About me:** I am currently a freshman at Dartmouth College pursuing a major in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. My interests are at the intersection between computer science, medicine, and cognitive science. On campus, I tutor high schoolers for CodingDojo, perform with the Chamber Orchestra, and serve on the exec board for West House. I also love tennis, ice skating, and going on long walks outdoors.
