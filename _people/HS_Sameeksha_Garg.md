**School:** Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

**About Me:**
I am a current junior in Virginia. I’ve been coding since late elementary school and I self-learned Python and machine learning. When I’m not studying or coding, I volunteer with a computer-science nonprofit, love to read, socialize, and paint.
