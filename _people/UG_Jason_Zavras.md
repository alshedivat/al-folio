**Undergrad:** Junior QSS/Pre-Medical Student at Dartmouth College

**Select Summer Projects:** TCGA Stain Normalization, Autoencoder

**About Me:** I am currently a rising Junior at Dartmouth College pursuing a major in Quantitative Social Science and following a Pre-Medical track. I was introduced to Dr. Vaickus’s impactful work through the Dartmouth Cancer Scholars Program and have had the great opportunity to explore the intersection of medicine and computer science. On campus, I enjoy volunteering with Dartmouth EMS, serving on Dartmouth’s Student Assembly, and am currently leading an independent project focusing on quantifying the impact of economic recessions on population health under varying healthcare environments made possible by the Stamps Scholar Foundation. After graduating, I hope to matriculate into a dual degree MD/MBA or MD/PhD in economics program and continue working at the forefront of medicine. This summer, I look forward to continuing my work on the TCGA Stain Normalization and Autoencoder projects.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis or basketball with friends, traveling, and taking advantage of the great outdoors northern New England has to offer. Feel free to reach out to connect at any time!
