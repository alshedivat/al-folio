<strong>Mercury photos analyzed by NASA; experts and guests eye them at Adler Planetarium<br>
NASA&rsquo;s new analysis of Mercury reveals geologic processes</strong><br><br>

For weeks, a team of NASA scientists studying Mercury has analyzed data from an unmanned flyby of the planet. They found a magnetic field with north and south poles and a weak atmosphere snagging particles blasting by in a solar wind.<br><br>

They saw a surface burned by streaming ions and scarred by evidence of lava flows and bits of crust lifted from beneath. For the first time, they appreciated Mercury as a planet alive with geologic processes, and it left them a bit stunned.<br><br>

In short, said Sean Solomon, principal investigator on the mission, Mercury showed things &ldquo;never seen before on another planet.&rdquo;<br><br>

On Wednesday, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials unveiled their first analysis of one of the solar system&rsquo;s least understood planets. The new insights come from 288 images of Mercury snapped by a space probe called MESSENGER as it flew past earlier this year.<br><br>

The high-resolution photos, shown on a wall of video screens, held a handful of visitors in rapture Wednesday. School groups in the hallway stopped and stared in wonder.<br><br>

On a couch in front of the display, Stephen Navolio smiled and murmured, &ldquo;This is fascinating!&rdquo; a couple of times. His wife, Margaret, smiled in amazement.
Mercury&rsquo;s Caloris basin, an impact crater filled with lava, shown on the tile display.
