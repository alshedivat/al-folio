October 23rd - 24th, 2010, EVL collaborator The Science Museum of Minnesota will showcase the TacTile multi-touch display system in the NSF Science and Technology Center - National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics (NCED) booth on the national mall as part of the USA Science and Engineering Festival.<br><br>

The <em>Rising Tide</em> application developed by EVL PhD candidate Khairi Reda will allow visitors to collaboratively explore the effect of sea-level rise on major urban areas in the US that are susceptible to sea-level rise.  Part of the ongoing Future Earth Initiative, <em>Rising Tide</em> consists of different scenarios of global sea-level rise with a photo realistic rendering to show how much land will be flooded due to sea rise.
