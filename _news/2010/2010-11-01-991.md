The December 2010 issue of the Australian Research &amp; Education Network&rsquo;s &ldquo;AARNews&rdquo; has a great article on the country&rsquo;s SAGE Bridge. The article appears below. <a href="http://www.aarnet.edu.au/library/AARNews_Issue19.pdf">Read a full copy of the newsletter</a>.<br><br>

<strong>SAGEBridge</strong><br><br>

The use of OptIPortal visualisation walls amongst Australian institutions has grown to a level where interaction beyond the usual point-to-point has become feasible. This has opened up interesting opportunities for multisite collaborations, which are now driving demand for stable middleware to manage such wall-to-multiwall interactions.<br><br>

SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment), developed by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is a cross-platform graphics streaming architecture that is gaining broader acceptance in serving this purpose.<br><br>

To further the opportunities of collaboration using SAGE in the Australian research community, the University of Queensland and AARNet have enabled the deployment of a SAGEBridge trial service with 10Gbps backbone connectivity. The SAGEBridge enables interactions between multiple walls by duplicating and splitting visual streams from one wall to other participating sites with a variety of bandwidth capabilities - a method dubbed &ldquo;VisualCasting&rdquo; or just &ldquo;VisCasting&rdquo;. Various VisCasting sessions have been conducted between SAGE enabled OptIPortals, particularly between AARNet (Sydney), University of Queensland and NICT in Japan, generating up to 7Gbps across the network, and over 10Gbps in the lab!<br><br>

A High Resolution Tiled Display workshop is being conducted at the Queensland University of Technology on 7 December as a part of the IEEE eScience 2010 Conference. This workshop is designed to cater both for new users as well as researchers who are already operating tiled display walls. The current and future applications of display wall technology will be discussed, including the role of SAGEBridge, and explore opportunities for participants to collaborate and contribute in a growing community. A feature presentation for this tutorial will be given by J&uuml;rgen Schulze from Calit2 at the University of California, San Diego. J&uuml;rgen is an expert in scientific visualisation in virtual environments, human-computer interaction, real-time volume rendering, and graphics algorithms on programmable graphics hardware.<br><br>

Following the workshop, an invitation will be extended to participants to expand the SAGEBridge trial, particularly to those on the far reaches of AARNet and its sister networks.
