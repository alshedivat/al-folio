The December 2010 issue of the Illinois Science &amp; Technology Coalition&rsquo;s online &ldquo;ISTC Catalyst&rdquo; newsletter features some of the exceptional work occurring in Illinois to engage students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Recognizing that STEM is the foundation for innovation and future economic prosperity, institutions and industry are devoting significant energy, time and resources to stimulate interest in STEM, and improve outcomes.<br><br>

Of the various activities cited, ISTC reproduces the recent article &ldquo;Gamer Edward Kahler Brings Talent to Argonne,&rdquo; that describes how a UIC computer science undergraduate, inspired by a video game class and then the opportunity to work at the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory, is now completing his master&rsquo;s degree while working on joint research with Argonne National Laboratory.<br><br>

The Illinois Science &amp; Technology Coalition cultivates economic development in Illinois by increasing resources for Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) initiatives at Illinois-based institutions and businesses.
