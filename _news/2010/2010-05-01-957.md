The National Science Foundation has awarded UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory a Major Research Instrumentation grant <em>MRI-R2: Development of the Next-Generation CAVE Virtual Environment (NG-CAVE)</em>, which will be world&rsquo;s first 2D+3D virtual reality environment built with near seamlessly tiled LCD panels, and provide a resolution matching human visual acuity. The NG-CAVE will support research, education and outreach in a variety of disciplines including: Computer Science, Bioengineering, Medicine, Engineering, High Performance Computing, Rehabilitation Science, and Art.<br><br>

The NG-CAVE was funded by NSF through the American Recover and Reinvestment Act.
