The annual Society for Information Display (SID) Symposium, May 23-28 in Seattle, Washington, is the premier international gathering of scientists, engineers, manufacturers and users for the discussion, presentation, viewing and evaluation of information display technology. This year&rsquo;s meeting featured a presentation on research by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, funded by Sharp Laboratories of America (SLA).<br><br>

DISPLAY MEDIA reported that SLA&rsquo;s Sachin Deshpande and Scott Daly showed a 10K x 4.5K resolution tiled display - driven by a computer cluster. Deshpande was interested in issues of multiple simultaneous users (what he called &ldquo;advanced user interaction&rdquo;) on the wall display, producing both new display and audio technologies.<br><br>

Not only did EVL help design and build the display wall at SLA, but SLA has been funding EVL to develop new and advanced user interfaces for tiled walls within its SAGE software environment. We are delighted that EVL&rsquo;s efforts were featured at the SID Symposium!<br><br>
