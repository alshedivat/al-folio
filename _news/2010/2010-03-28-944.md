The Female Eye Film Festival established in 2001, is Ontario&rsquo;s one and only annual international independent film Festival showcasing films directed by women. It is a juried competitive film festival and presents films by debut, emerging and internationally recognized directors.<br><br>

Among artists featured in this year&rsquo;s festival is EVLer Heejoo Kim with her work entitled <em>Unwearable Functional Garments II</em>. <em>Unwearable Functional Garments II</em> is a 5 minute experimental film produced using Maya, Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, hand drawing techniques, and a host of other digital tools that result in complex layer visual scenes. The work portrays the redesigned and reconstructed garments for three iconic princesses: The Little Mermaid, Snow White, and Cinderella.<br><br>

Kim&rsquo;s screening will be held March 28th 11-12:30pm.
