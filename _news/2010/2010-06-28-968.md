JUNE 28, 2010, NASA - Helen-Nicole Kostis, an alumna of the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), is profiled in the June 28th issue of <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/people/features/visualizer-creates-earth.html">NASA NEWS &amp; FEATURES</a>. Kostis works as part of a team of visualizers who translate raw scientific satellite data into stunning visual imagery for the Earth Sciences. The visualizations help both scientists and the general public better understand the data NASA satellites and airborne missions provide in order to better comprehend complex phenomena invisible to the naked eye and &ldquo;see&rdquo; how the planet works. The imagery they create is scientifically accurate to a degree few others match.<br><br>

Kostis graduated UIC in 2006 with an MS in Computer Science and an MFA in Electronic Visualization. While a student and research assistant at UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), Kostis&rsquo; focus was on the design and development of collaborative virtual-reality art works, which she demonstrated at many international conferences and festivals. Upon leaving UIC, she took a position as Research Associate at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center&rsquo;s (GSFC) Scientific Visualization Studio (SVS). She also holds a faculty position at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County (UMBC).
