In March 2010, UIC published Impact magazine, showcasing UIC&rsquo;s endeavors, &ldquo;?&hellip;that have made and will continue to make lasting contributions to Chicago, the nation and the world.&rdquo; One of the articles profiles Maxine Brown, associate director of UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory, for her efforts in helping build StarLight - North America&rsquo;s largest research and education networking hub - which is located in downtown Chicago. For the article, see: <a href="http://www.uic.edu/depts/omc/impact/visionary.html">www.uic.edu/depts/omc/impact/visionary.html</a>.<br><br>

This article is based on recognition Brown received in March 2009, where she was selected as one of 10 Global Visionaries and featured in the multi-media public affairs series &ldquo;Chicago Matters: Beyond Burnham&rdquo;. This series was put together by WBEZ Chicago Public Radio and WTTW Chicago Public Television. Those interviews can be found at:<br>
