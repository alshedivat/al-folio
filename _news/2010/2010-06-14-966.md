By moving the light of a flashlight along the facade of a building, the viewers create musical compositions while lighting architectural elements.<br><br>

<em>Play the Magic</em>, including EVL MFA graduate Julio Obelleiro is an art group focused on creating shifts and illusions in the perception of the viewers by means of interactive installations where the viewer creates the experience through interaction.<br><br>
