Simulation and modeling of turbulent flow, and of turbulent reacting flowin particular, involves solving for and analyzing time-dependent and spatially dense tensor quantities, such as turbulent stress tensors. Visual exploration of these tensor quantities can effectively steer the computational modeling of combustion systems. The project builds a visual analysis tool to be utilized in debugging, benchmarking, and verification of models and solutions in turbulent combustion.
