Applied Interactives is pleased to announce the first public showing of it&rsquo;s latest virtual reality artwork Special Treatment.<br><br>

Special Treatment is an ongoing project that began in the Spring of 2002 in collaboration with (art)n Laboratory. We are welcoming members of the community and press to our studio / gallery for an open house in conjunction with the IEEE VR 2004 conference on Saturday, March 27 from 6:00 - 9:00pm.<br><br>

Yggdrasil, a VR artwork by Swedish artists Bino and Cool will also be exhibited on our VR Portal system.<br><br>

The event is open to the public and there will be food and refreshments.<br><br>

Special Treatment by Applied Interactives is a Virtual Reality based artwork that blends the architectures of history and memory. The experiences victims, survivors, oppressors, and contemporary visitors are combined in the work to recreate a no-man&rsquo;s land built around the worst atrocities mankind has visited upon itself.  Applied Interactives is a collaborative group of artists and technologists dedicated to the development and use of interactive and immersive technologies as an accessible and affordable creative visualization medium.<br><br>

Yggdrasil is a journey in time through a Swedish pagan history of the gods. Bino and Cool are VR artists and researchers in visualization at KTH in Stockholm, as well as creators of the VR art applications Yggdrasil and Giza. They are additionally founders of the VR company Virtual Rules.<br><br>
