After six years at the helm as EVL director and twenty-six years as an associate director, Maxine Brown retires effective October 1, 2020.  Over the years, Maxine has led and been instrumental in EVL&rsquo;s interdisciplinary research and development specializing in collaborative visualization, virtual reality, visual data science, and advanced computing and networking infrastructure.<br><br>
Most notable, during Maxine&rsquo;s tenure as director, EVL invented the CAVE2&trade; hybrid-reality environment, developed the Continuum Smart Environment and collaborative middle-ware SAGE&trade; scalable adaptive graphics environment, as well as the SAGE2&trade; scalable amplified group environment.  In collaboration with Northwestern University and Argonne National Laboratory, Maxine managed the EVL team to create STAR TAP (1997), Ithe research and education network connection facility for international traffic located in downtown Chicago.  STAR TAP was followed by StarLight (2001), which is still the largest research and engineering advanced networking facility in the world.<br><br>
Maxine&rsquo;s contributions to EVL are numerous and significant.  She will be sorely missed by faculty, staff, students and many colleagues worldwide.  Andrew Johnson, EVL director of research and professor of Computer Science assumes the role of EVL&rsquo;s interim director.<br><br>
