EVL researchers, PhD candidates Robert Kooima and Tom Peterka complete advancements in EVL&rsquo;s Varrier&trade; Autostereo display system research.  The latest Varrier systems have twice the resolution and increased rendering performance as a result of the development of a new algorithm, Varrier Combiner, that exploits programmable graphics processing for significantly increased sub-pixel Varrier line screen rendering performance; sub-pixel-scale rendering is no longer more expensive than pixel-scale rendering. This has afforded system developers to reduce the resolution of the parallax barrier down from pixel scale to sub-pixel scale, resulting in tremendous resolution and performance gains.<br><br>

Calit2 at the University of California at San Diego has recently deployed that world&rsquo;s largest Varrier system at 65-panels that takes advantage of this research <em>(pictured right: EVL Directors, Tom DeFanti, Dan Sandin, and Post-doctoral Research Associate, Javier Girado assist Calit2 staff on the installation of the 65-panel Varrier at Calit2.

In late 2006 researchers deployed a 65-panel Cylindrical Varrier Autostereo VR Display system at Calit2.
