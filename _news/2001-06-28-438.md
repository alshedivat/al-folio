The National Science Foundation (NSF) hosted an interactive news conference to communicate preliminary results of a study on NSF&rsquo;s Urban Systemic Initiatives (USI) in K12 mathematics and science education, a program begun in 1993. School systems in more than 20 major cities have undergone major reforms to improve math and science education. A summary report, Academic Excellence for All Urban Students, is based on a larger ongoing study, and provides context for detailed data that have been gathered on the progress of students in urban systems that have undertaken reforms.<br><br>

To announce these results, NSF organized its first multi-site on-line news conference in an application of the latest &ldquo;Grid&rdquo; networking technology. NSF officials in Arlington, Va., and selected city school officials from facilities near their home sites, communicated their experiences with education system reform.
