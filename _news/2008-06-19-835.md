Iowa is sinking, and the ravenous waters of the Mississippi River continue to pound away at Illinois levees as the worst floods in years crash into Missouri. It&rsquo;s there that a team of St. Louis environmental scientists have strung together high-end DLP projectors, strapped on their 3D glasses and set out to tell Americans where not to risk it next time.<br><br>

An article in Popular Mechanics discusses a project by Saint Louis University earth scientists that uses advanced 3-dimensional mapping technology to create simulated flood plains using detailed topographical, photographic, and imaging data.<br><br>

These digital models can mitigate the damage done by the next big flood by showing developers where not to build - highlighting the most vulnerable spots along the river and showing what areas are most likely to be hit hardest in the future.
