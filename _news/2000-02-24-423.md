The goal of the ASCI Advanced Projector Workshop was to develop a white paper and roadmap for the accelerated development of next-generation projection technology. At the conclusion of the meeting, however, it was determined that attendees had specific interests or needs and that there was no universal solution possible. It was decided that future meetings would be necessary to create group consensus on future projector requirements and to prioritize concerns. In addition, since some of the requirements were high-risk and/or focused on narrow user communities, attendees were encouraged to seek alternate solutions.
