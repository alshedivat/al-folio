EVL team, headed by Principal Investigator Jason Leigh (Professor, Computer Science) and co-PIs Maxine Brown (Associate Director EVL) and Luc Renambot (Research Associate Professor, Computer Science) has received a new $5 million award from the National Science Foundation for the project entitled &ldquo;SI2-SSI: SAGEnext: Next Generation Integrated Persistent Visualization and Collaboration Services for Global Cyberinfrastructure&rdquo;.<br><br>

The award period is October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2018 to develop SAGEnext - the next generation of  EVL&rsquo;s widely used SAGE software for enabling researchers to collaboratively visualize data on ultra high resolution displays, and over long distance high speed networks. SAGE (the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment) is currently being used by over 100 institutions worldwide. SAGEnext will focus on the development of the critical software infrastructure needed to empower scientists and engineers to fuse data that is growing exponentially in scale and complexity, in order to more rapidly address problems of national priority - such as global climate change, health informatics, or homeland security. These same tools can better communicate scientific concepts to public policy and government officials, and via museum exhibitions, to the general public.
