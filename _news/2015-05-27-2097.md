To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) - back when it was named University of Illinois Chicago Circle (UICC) â€” the UIC Alumni magazine&rsquo;s Spring 2015 issue has a wonderfully nostalgic article titled &ldquo;The Circle&rdquo; by Daniel P. Smith that highlights 50 moments in the history of the campus.<br><br>
Number 49 on the list is the computer graphics imagery (CGI) created by the UICC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL - known back then as the Circle Graphics Habitat) for the &ldquo;Attacking the Death Star Will Not be Easy&rdquo; sequence in the 1977 Star Wars film.<br><br>
