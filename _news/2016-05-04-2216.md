UIC Computer Science and EVL exchange student from the Politecnico di Milano in Italy, Marco Cavallo presents his thesis research on Mixed Reality.<br><br>
&ldquo;Merging Worlds: A Location-based Approach to Mixed Reality&rdquo; presents a novel approach to the design of Mixed Reality (MR) applications, which combines elements from markerless and location-based Augmented Reality in order to explore new types of interaction, leveraging a spatial representation of virtual content. In particular, a method for developing both a mobile application, that can be used by people to see augmented content in the real world, and an editor application, which can be used to design and create MR experiences is proposed.
