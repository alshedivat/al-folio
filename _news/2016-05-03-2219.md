EVL Cyber-Commons, Room 2068 ERF<br><br>
UIC Computer Science and EVL exchange student from the Politecnico di Milano in Italy, Fillipo Pellolio presents his Master thesis research on the development of an electronic whiteboard for large multt-touch displays, SAGEBoard.<br><br>
SAGEBoard provides users with the capability to perform classic whiteboard actions such as drawing or writing free-handed on the screen using their finger or a stylus - or use brushes to paint and erase content. Content can be relocated on the screen, new content inserted, and sessions saved and reloaded.  Content can be shared between all the users with simultaneous interaction, improving the collaborative task.  SAGEBoard is designed to be used locally or remotely where sessions can be shared in real-time between a number of participating sites.
