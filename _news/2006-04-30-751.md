The Gender and Women&rsquo;s Studies Department has named EVL REU Elisa Green as the recipient of the 2006 Mary B. Bialas Award.<br><br>

The Mary B. Bialas Award is a scholarship awarded annually to a student who has participated in the Gender and Women&rsquo;s Studies program. Applicants should have demonstrated a commitment to women and/or children&rsquo;s issues and actively worked to improve the lives of women and children.<br><br>

Green received the award for her activism and work on women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s issues in a non-western context. During the previous year she has been an intern with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Ankara, Turkey. As a focal point member of the Gender and Children&rsquo;s Team (GCT) she was actively involved in policy issues that concerned the protection of refugee women and children.
