SAGE2 is a user-centered platform for small groups or large distributed teams to access digital media datasets from various sources and juxtapose, share and investigate content on tiled display walls. SAGE2 builds on SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment), developed with prior NSF funding. With 90 SAGE2 sites worldwide since 2015, SAGE2 is having a transformative effect on data exploration, visualization and collaboration, making cyberinfrastructure more accessible to end users, both in the laboratory and in the classroom.<br><br>
