NOVEMBER 7, 2018 - Trina Roy, a UIC alumna who majored in Computer Science and worked as a research assistant at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), is being honored with an Outstanding Achievement Award by the College of Engineering (COE) and the Engineering Alumni Association. An annual Awards Dinner will celebrate and recognize the accomplishments and distinguished careers of several engineering and computer science alumni. This year&rsquo;s  dinner is being held Wednesday November 7.<br><br>
Roy, currently a Senior Software Developer at Pixar Animation Studios, was previously invited to give the commencement address at the UIC COE Commencement in May 2017 because of her impressive computer-graphics career at major special-effects companies. She gave a motivating speech that focused on the value of good mentors, mutual respect and perseverance to achieve oneâ€™s dreams. While her focus was more on empowering young women, her presentation made clear that everyone needs to respect and help one another in today&rsquo;s world. Afterwards, young women graduates thanked her for her presentation. Young men graduates primarily thanked her for making great Pixar movies! <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/entry.php?id=2293">More details on her commencement speech.</a><br><br>
