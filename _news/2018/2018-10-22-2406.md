OCTOBER 22, 2018 - UIC EVL/MFA graduate JD Pirtle recently started his own company, <a href="https://www.depthandlight.com/">Depth and Light</a> which is an education, technology, and design studio+consultancy. Its mission is to help students, teachers, and learners of all ages feel confident using traditional and emerging technology for research, inquiry, and creativity.<br><br> 
JD, as an EVL/MFA student, helped develop both the &ldquo;20 Foot Virtual Canvas&rdquo; multi-touch paint system and the &ldquo;Mega Tenori-on&rdquo; virtual sound instrument for EVL&rsquo;s large-scale tiled display wall, called Cyber-Commons.<br><br>
After graduating UIC, EVL retained JD to complete development of the CAVE2 sound library. He was then hired by Chicago&rsquo;s Catherine Cook School (preschool - 8th grade) as Director of Innovation, and promptly created IDEA (Innovation, Design, Engineering, Art) Lab, a school-wide, cross-divisional program that included 3D printers, a laser cutter/engraver, a large interactive display wall running EVL/LAVA&rsquo;s SAGE2 software, robotics, sewing equipment, and traditional shop tools. He ran several successful IDEA:TE Transforming Education workshops, too, targeted for preschool - 12th grade educators to discuss how best to integrate traditional and emerging technologies into their curriculum.<br><br>
Now JD brings us Depth and Light. As the website says &ldquo;Technology is magical, but it's not magic.&rdquo; JD is certainly a wizard behind the curtain, and we wish him luck in his new venture!
