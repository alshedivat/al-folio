SAGE2 is a web-based, user-centered platform for small groups or distributed teams to access digital media datasets from various
sources and share and investigate content on display walls. SAGE2 builds on SAGE, previously funded by NSF. By making cyberinfrastructure more accessible to end systems and to end users, both in the lab and in the classroom, SAGE2 is transforming data visualization, data exploration and collaboration.<br><br>
