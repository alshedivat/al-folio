The week of October 25, the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at University of Illinois at Chicago hosted Marcella McCarthy, a graduate student from Northwestern University&rsquo;s Medill School of Journalism, who was doing a practicum for her science writing class. Marcella&rsquo;s interest is in design, innovation and technology, and she chose to profile the students behind EVL&rsquo;s latest application, the &ldquo;20-foot canvas&rdquo; paint program, developed for its Cyber-Commons&rsquo; large tiled display wall with its touch-screen interface. The video and accompanying text story are very well done.<br><br>

Nov 04, 2010 - JD Pirtle, 35, held a paintbrush up to his chin, and like a traditional painter, contemplated what he was going to paint that day. But he wasn&rsquo;t using any paint and he wasn&rsquo;t even using a canvas. Instead, he just walked up to a wall comprised of HD screens. With a flick of the wrist and a light stroke, he began painting a sunflower on the virtual wall.<br><br>

&ldquo;I like to call it 20-foot canvas,&rdquo; said Pirtle, who is earning his masters degree in fine arts at the University of Illinois at Chicago and is the lead artist on the paint project.<br><br>

Students have built a wall out of 18 HD screens with an astounding number of pixels: 8160 x 2304. A comparable single screen comprises 1920 x 1080 pixels. But wait, it gets better. This summer, a group of five students made the wall touch-enabled and created an application for the iPad that allows more than one person to paint on the virtual wall.<br><br>
