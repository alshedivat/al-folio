<em>Biological Agents: Artistic Engagements in our Growing Bio-Culture</em><br>
Curated by Christa Donner and Andrew Yang<br><br>

<strong>Opening reception: Wednesday, October 15, 5-8pm</strong><br>
Gallery 400, 400 S. Peoria Street, Chicago<br><br>

EVL MFA graduate student, Andrew Oleksiuk has a created comic book for Biological Agents, entitled <em>Mermaids of the Chicago River</em>. The new work grew out of a virtual world interactive installation and the comic book and zine traditions using contemporary electronic visualization techniques. Fantasy is juxtaposed with a call to environmental activism to provide an eerie commentary on human nature. Pick up your free copy at he Knowledge Virus Research Station at the show or download under related documents at the right of this webpage.<br><br>

The complexities of our contemporary life fundamentally challenge the way we understand ourselves as biological entities within larger ecosystems. Biological Agents focuses on the work of Brandon Ballang&eacute;e, Caitlin Berrigan, and Natalie Jeremijenko: three artists who engage the intimate participation of organisms and the public alike, examining what it means to be human, to be animal, and to have personal and social agency. The companion Knowledge Virus Research Station offers more information on biological topics from a variety of creative perspectives.<br><br>
