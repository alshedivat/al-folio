I'm grateful to share that Sameer Singh is hosting a course on _Machine Learning
for NLP_ at the [Summer School on Computational Cognitive Modeling for Language Summer School 2022](https://www.langsci.uci.edu/summerschool.php), hosted at UCI. The event
starts on the 1st of August and runs for a week until the 5th of August. 

During this week, we cover the basics of word-embeddings, tokenization,
encoder-decoder models, as well as how these individual components affect the
different NLP tasks. We cover the recent transformers-based trend and challenge
students to find problems and limitations on the existing models.

***

My responsibilities include the creation of [interactive notebooks](https://github.com/PastelBelem8/ml4nlp-cogsci-summer22). 
We use mostly HuggingFace and OpenAI APIs to interact with state-of-the-art
NLP models. These notebooks were inspired on several other available blogposts
and resources.
