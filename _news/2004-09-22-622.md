Poliana Tassini presents the comparative analysis traced in Angela Ndalianis&rsquo; book &ldquo;Neo-Baroque Aesthetics and Contemporary Entertainment&rdquo; between the baroque aesthetics from the 17th century and the neo-baroque era in the Contemporary Entertainment of 20th / 21st centuries. According to Ndalianis, &ldquo;the neo-baroque shares a baroque delight in spectacle and sensory experiences, a spectacle that, in our time, often relies upon computer technology.&rdquo; Using examples from video-games, CGI movies and theme-park attractions in VR, we will understand how the contemporary entertainment media reflect the new &ldquo;neo-baroque logic&rdquo; as a result of the technological advancements of our time.
