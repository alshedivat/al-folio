EVL faculty and Computer Science associate professor G. Elisabeta Marai (MPI) along with H. Shatkay (MPI) at the University of Delaware have been awarded supplemental funding for COVID-19 related research to their NIH research project entitled &ldquo;Uncovering Clinical Evidence in COVID-19 Publications: An Integrated Search via Text &amp; Images&rdquo;.  This supplement expands the work done under current R01 funding &ldquo;Incorporating Image-based Features into Biomedical Document Classification&rdquo;, to support discovery within the CORD-19 collection -- a large, continually updated collection of more than 60,000 scientific articles pertaining to COVID-19. This supplement will create a comprehensive platform for retrieving and displaying well-focused, need-targeted medical information within COVID-19 biomedical publications.  Our approach is unique compared to other text-mining methods because it leverages the image content in the dataset.<br><br>
<i>Funding: NIH R01 NLM Covid-19 supplement to Parent Grant: 1R01LM012527 (&ldquo;Incorporating Image-based Features into Biomedical Document Classification&rdquo;)</i>
