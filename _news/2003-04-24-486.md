EVL is participating in the annual eighth annual UIC&rsquo;s Daughters @ Work Day, organized by the UIC Office of Women&rsquo;s Affairs. This event is inspired by the national Take Our Daughters to Work Day founded by the Ms. Foundation to help combat the dramatic decrease in career aspirations and self esteem that happens in girls ages 9 to 15. The goal of UIC&rsquo;s Daughters @ Work Day is to provide the girls with positive work role models, expose them to the variety of career possibilities, and to showcase UIC as a place to pursue their educational or career aspirations. As a participating site, EVL women will host CAVE demonstrations and hold a question / answer session.
