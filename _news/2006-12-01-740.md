Sabrina Raaf will exhibit new work as part of a group show, <em>Darling Project</em> at Wendy Cooper Gallery. The Opening Reception will be held December 1, 2006 from 6-9pm. The show will run until February 8, 2007. Gallery Hours are Friday and Saturday, 12 - 6 and by appointment at 312-455-1195 or Wendy Cooper at wendy @ wendy coopergallery.com.<br><br>

The <em>Darling Project</em> will be the final show at Wendy Cooper&rsquo;s 119 N. Peoria St. location, and the exhibit will show new work by gallery artists with the addition of four new artists. Moving from operating out of a stationary location, Wendy Cooper will shift into working nationally and internationally as a private dealer, curator and advisor. The title of this show, <em>Darling Project</em>, refers to the idea of a love letter, that each project, artist and exhibition is revered and handled with passion and energy. To celebrate the success of their artists achievements and the future of Wendy Cooper&rsquo;s business pursuits, the gallery will host a reception on December 1st from 6-9pm.<br><br>

The exhibition will feature work by : Noelle Allen, Katrin Asbury, Drew Beattie, Zo&euml; Charlton, Xylor Jane, Martin McMurray, Amy Park, Sabrina Raaf, Thorina Rose, Rita Rubas, Eduardo Santiere, J. Shimon &amp; J. Lindemann, Jered Sprecher, TL Solien, and Ann Toebbe.
