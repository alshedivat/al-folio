&ldquo;Space, Place &amp; Interface&rdquo;<br><br>

Exhibiting artists are exploring themes of spatial relatedness and social interplay within defined settings. The exhibit encompasses interactive, new media and video work. Our mission is to bring video and new media to the public in innovative ways. LiveBox considers Chicago as its gallery, and will exhibit throughout Chicagoland in conventional and non-conventional settings.<br><br>
