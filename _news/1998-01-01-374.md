EVL as part of the Tele-Immersion initiative led by Jaron Lanier and Advanced Network &amp; Services (ANS) is focusing upon allowing users in different locations to collaborate in shared virtual environments. This initiative aims to pool expertise and research from different facilities, and to &ldquo;develop plans to build a national tele-immersive research infrastructure.&rdquo;<br><br>

The initial plans call for the building of telecubicles - a telecubicle is an immersive virtual reality office environment that can be networked to other telecubicles.<br><br>

EVL is working with the Naval Post Graduate School (NPS) to develop the underlying operating infrastructure / environment for the telecubicles.<br><br>

<em>EVL is no longer directly involved in the (ANS) initiative, though continues to conduct research in the development of desktop and office virtual reality devices/infrastructure (1/2000).</em>
