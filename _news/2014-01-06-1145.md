The new SAGE Forum website, now available on LinkedIn, has been created to better serve the SAGE User Community. Please take a moment to join the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/l69myfa">SAGE Forum</a>.<br><br>

This community Forum has been created to better respond to user questions, to stimulate more discussion, and to better track and understand application uses and requirements. The Forum is monitored by the SAGE Team at the University of Illinois at Chicago&trade;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) and the technical team at Vadiza, Inc., a company that recently licensed EVL&trade;s SAGE and is creating an enterprise version to sell with tiled display wall appliances and portable systems.<br><br>

There is no cost to participate in the SAGE Forum. For those who find that they prefer more timely responses to questions, contact <a href="http://www.vadiza.com">Vadiza</a> for support, support@vadiza.com, or (855) 344-8400.<br><br>

Thanks for your ongoing interest in and use of SAGE!
