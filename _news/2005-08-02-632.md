EVL&rsquo;s Drew Browning and collaborator Annette Barbier will be exhibiting several new works at the 59th Annual UFVA (University Film and Video Association) conference (August 2 - 6, 2005). The conference schedule promises a stimulating selection of screenings, readings, discussions, installations, and demonstrations - all against the backdrop of one of the country&rsquo;s most beautiful and diverse cities.<br><br>

Browning and Barbier have had a busy and exciting summer as they developed their new interactive work, &ldquo;Path of the Dragon&rdquo;. The river journey is the form of this installation in which a participant is a traveler in a mythic voyage through the ages of a nation, Vietnam. Beginning at dawn, the participant navigates through three levels: a past lived close to nature, a time of horrific upheaval and violence, and a time of adapting and rebuilding.<br><br>

Visit the artists&rsquo; efforts in Photon Flow: UFVA 2005 New Media Exhibition at the Glass Curtain Gallery. This installation is based on the media performance Browning and Barbier showcased last summer, River of Many Sides.<br><br>
