Multi-device environments present new opportunities for collaborative visual data analysis and sense-making by utilizing each device&rsquo;s strengths and capabilities. However, one of the associated challenges with visual data analysis in multi-device environments is the sharing of visual components across devices. We present a framework developed on top of SAGE2 platform for cross-device collaborative visual data exploration. As part of our framework, we contribute to the concept of rapid development and assembling of visualizations that can span multiple devices of different modalities. It provides the users with an environment for visualization compositions that delegate the rendering to the target device, allowing them to augment their large display workspace with portable devices for further exploration territories. Facilitated by its intuitive visualization composition pipeline, users with no programming skills such as data analysts can enhance their analytical scope with no coding barriers. We describe the framework, its implementation with a use case, and the rationale behind its design.<br><br>
