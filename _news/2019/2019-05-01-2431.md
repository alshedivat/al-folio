This article provides a 25 year-long perspective on Immersive Analytics through the lens of first-in-kind technological advancements introduced at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory, University of Illinois at Chicago, along with the challenges and lessons learned from multiple Immersive Analytics projects.<br><br>
The Electronic Visualization Lab (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago has been at the forefront of Virtual Reality research since 1992, when it introduced the CAVE&trade; Automatic Virtual Environment, the first projection-based virtual reality system in the world. Since then, the lab has developed a wide range of immersive systems and technologies to be used for visualization and visual analysis tasks, such as PARIS&trade;, ImmersaDesk&trade;, CAVE2&trade;, and SAGE2&trade;. These technologies paved the way for the resurgence in virtual reality in the past few years, and lead to the introduction of Immersive Analytics - which investigates how new interaction
and display technologies can be used to support analytical reasoning by immersing the users in data.<br><br>
