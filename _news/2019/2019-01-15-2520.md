<i>Transforming Storytelling: Multiuser Virtual Reality Theater for Collaborative Tele-Immersive Interaction (aka &ldquo;Hummignbird&rdquo;)</i> is a collaborative project between the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and the <a href="https://www.goodmantheatre.org/">Goodman Theatre</a>.  Led by Daria Tsoupikova, professor of the UIC School of Design in conjunction with Goodman&rsquo;s Jo Cattell, &ldquo;Hummingbird&rdquo; is a multiuser theatrical performance that merges real and virtual worlds with the goal of encouraging stronger theatrical engagement with a tech-savvy younger generation audience.<br><br>
The project is being designed for the Goodman Theater New Stages, which showcases innovative and experimental theater works.  Chicago youth will experience &ldquo;Hummingbird&rdquo; by attending tele-immersive real-time performances running concurrently at the Goodman Theatre&rsquo;s Alice Rapport Center and EVL&rsquo;s Continuum smart space.<br><br>
&ldquo;Hummingbird&rdquo; performers will take theatergoers on a tele-immersive journey donning virtual reality head-mounted displays and interacting with the virtual environment to tell a story via this new medium.<br><br>
Performances are anticipated for mid-2021 pending pandemic regulations and clearances.
