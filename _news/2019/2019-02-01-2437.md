Cancer has a major impact on society all around the world. It affects people of all population groups though certain groups bear more burden of cancer. Some of the contributing factors for cancer disparities are socioeconomic status, geographic location, race/ethnicity. The objective of this project is to provide an interface to show cancer incidents and address the effect of different socioeconomic factors on cancer incidents in the areas of Chicago.<br><br>
The web-based application was developed by Computer Science Master degree-seeking graduate student Yashika Goyal, under the advisement of EVL and Computer Science associate professor, G. Elisabeta Marai.
