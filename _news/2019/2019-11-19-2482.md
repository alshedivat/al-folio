Plepys, Associate Director of the UIC Computer Science department&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory and Associate Director of the UIC Software Technologies Research Center (STRC), has distinguished herself as an exemplary UIC academic professional who has made outstanding contributions, both administrative and technical, to EVL and STRC&rsquo;s successes.
