Abstract: The landscape of cyberinfrastructure for research is rapidly changing. There is a move towards virtualized and programmable infrastructure. The cloud paradigm enables applications to use computing resources at different places and optimize workflows in either bringing computing to the data or the other way around. Programmable networks allow networks to be utilized in unprecedented ways to create application-specific Internets. This talk presents the latest developments in the Research and Education Networks to support Big Data sciences.<br><br>
