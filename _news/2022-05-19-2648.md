School of Design and EVL professor Daria Tsoupikova has been recognized with the UIC Award for Creative Activity for 2022-2023.  Daria is among 42 faculty members awarded to continue their pursuits of creative scholarship and activities at UIC.  Daria will use this award to further enhance and showcase &ldquo;Hummingbird: Collaborative Virtual Reality for Tele-Immersive Interactive Theater
Virtual Reality&rdquo; developed in collaboration with Chicago&rsquo;s Goodman Theatre.  This innovative work merges real and virtual worlds for tele-immersive interaction with the goal of encouraging stronger theater engagement with tech-savvy younger audiences. Participants follow the story&rsquo;s protagonist into an immersive virtual world reminiscent of Japanese paintings. This tele-immersive, interactive experience reimagines theatrical storytelling.<br><br>
The project bridges art, science and live theater through a collaborative research effort between computer science and design faculty and students at EVL and Chicago&rsquo;s Goodman Theatre.<br><br>
