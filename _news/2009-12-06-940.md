The 4th CineGrid International Workshop was held December 6-9, 2009 at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2), University of California San Diego. The Workshop brought together technologists, researchers and industry leaders to discuss and demonstrate the latest developments and research in networked collaborative tools to enable the production, use and exchange of very high-quality digital media over photonic networks.<br><br>

EVL representatives actively participated in the Workshop program; EVL associate director, Dana Plepys moderated the tutorial session <em>&ldquo;Introduction to iRODS for CineGrid Exchange (CX) Operations&rdquo;</em> with co-presenters Bing Zhu, DICE, and Shaofeng Liu, UCSD/Calit2. Also, in her role as CX director / curator, Plepys provided a status report on the progress of the CX, a multi-site distributed digital media repository supporting testbeds for research and applications in digital media asset management, distribution and preservation.<br><br>

Director, Jason Leigh presented EVL&rsquo;s latest research on the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment (SAGE), the fundamental software that drives ultra-resolution visualization display instruments interconnected by high-speed networks - OptIPortals.  <em>&ldquo;Building CineGrid Nodes Using SAGE OptIPortals - The Path Forward&rdquo;</em> was part of the presentation session moderated by Tom DeFanti (EVL director emeritus) - <em>&ldquo;Building CineGrid Nodes.&rdquo;</em><br><br>

Research assistant professor, Luc Renambot conducted SAGE demonstrations between EVL in Chicago and Calit2 in San Diego, showing the system in practical use and highlighting the latest user interface and interaction features most recently developed by EVL researchers.<br><br>

The Workshop was organized by Pacific Interface, Inc. and sponsored by CineGrid.
