NOVEMBER 11-16, 2018 - Members of the SAGE2&trade; Team who attended the IEEE/ACM SC18 conference - from University of Hawaiʻi at Manoa’s Laboratory for Advanced Visualization & Applications (LAVA), University of Illinois at Chicago’s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), and University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo - were involved in many tech transfer activities, notably research demonstrations, a Birds of a Feather (BOF) meeting, and maintaining and developing content for three SAGE2 walls managed by the SCinet DevOps team. The SC18 conference was held at the Kay Bailey Hutchinson Convention Center in Dallas, Texas.<br><br>
<strong>SAGE2 BOF</strong><br>
The &ldquo;SAGE2 10th Annual International SC BOF: Scalable Amplified Group Environment for Global Collaboration&rdquo; meeting was held on Tuesday, November 13, 2018. The BOF provided a Forum for SAGE2 developers to meet with the SAGE/SAGE2 global user community and potential users; specifically:<br>
To introduce key SAGE2 team members<br>
To highlight new SAGE2 sites and use cases<br>
To introduce SAGE2 v4 (named &ldquo;Cahokia&rdquo;)<br>
To elicit community input on cybersecurity enhancements<br>
To provide a forum for discussion and feedback<br><br>

<strong>SAGE2 Demonstrations</strong><br>
SAGE2 demonstrations took place in the StarLight research booth on the exhibition floor, November 12-15, 2017.  Booth attendees saw firsthand SAGE2 v4&rsquo;s many new and advanced features, and talked with the key developers:<br>
SAGE2 Performance Improvements<br>
SAGE2 Quick Notes Improvements<br>
SAGE2 JupyterLab Extension<br>
SAGE2 Asset Management<br>
SAGE2 and Unity3D<br>
SAGE2 Identity Management and Security<br>
Model for Cybersecure SAGE2<br><br>
In addition, SAGE2 partners from Japan&rsquo;s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) organized and hosted a SAGE2 tutorial in their research booth on the show floor, and also participated in collaborative demos between their booth and the StarLight booth.<br><br>
SAGE2 partner Calit2-Qualcomm Institute at the University of California, San Diego, hosted a remote presentation on our SAGE2 display by Scott Stellars about their NSF CHASE-CI award (Cognitive Hardware and Software Ecosystem, Community Infrastructure) and their use of Kubernetes.<br><br>
<strong>SAGE2 SCinet Participation</strong><br>
SCinet is the SC conference&rsquo;s highly sophisticated, high-performance network infrastructure that is designed and implemented by a large group of academic, government and industry volunteers. SCinet&rsquo;s DevOps Team runs the internal software infrastructure for SCinet - including software to monitor and measure network flows to ensure services and provide alerts when there are issues. Starting in 2016, SCinet DevOps used SAGE2 on a tiled display wall outside their Network Operations Center in order to provide attendees with large-scale images about the network. This year, SCinet upgraded its SAGE2 display and computer technology and hosted three SAGE2 walls at the conference - one outside SCinet, one for a new venue called SC News (with live and recorded videos), and one at the special SC18 30th Anniversary booth. Andrew Burks, a member of the SAGE2 Team from EVL, oversaw the operation of the three walls with help from other SAGE2 Team members and produced several visual analytic diagrams over the course of the week that were displayed both on SCinet’s wall as well as in the SAGE2 research booth.
