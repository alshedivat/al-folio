I am employed as a Research Software Engineer under the supervision of Associate Professor Kostas Marias in the Computational Biomedicine Lab of the Institute of Computer Science, Foundation of Research and Technology Hellas.

I work in:

1. the H2020 funded project [InSilc](https://insilc.eu/) in which my main responsibilities relate to the implement and testing of a number of algorithmic approaches for the registration of IVUS images before and after stent procedure.
2. the H2020 funded project [SeeFar](https://www.see-far.eu/) on the development and evaluation of methods for the detection and the progression of retina diseases (diabetic retinopathy and  age-related macular degeneration), as well as diseases that are not related with the eyes health, but signs of the diseases can be detected by the analysis of retina images (e.g. cardiovascular risk). Both traditional (featured based) machine learning approaches as well as deep learning methods will be explored and evaluated  with respect to accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis and prediction.
