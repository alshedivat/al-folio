Thomas A. DeFanti, Co-Director of the Eelectronic Visualization Laboratory, Director of the Software Technologies Research Center, and Professor in the Computer Science Department is named a *ldquo;UIC Distinguished Professor&rdquo;.<br><br>

This title was created to recognize and honor faculty at the rank of professor who have made major impact upon their field through scholarship, creativity, and leadership. A panel of current UIC Distinguished Professors and University Scholars carefully reviewed the nominations as did the Campus Research Board and the Vice Chancellor for Research to select this year&rsquo;s recipients.<br><br>
