&ldquo;Redefining the Medical Artist&rdquo; - an exhibition curated by Meena Malhotra, a Master&rsquo;s student in the UIC Biomedical Visualization program - is on view at the International Museum of Surgical Science (1524 N Lake Shore Drive, Chicago) through October 17, 2009. The exhibition&rsquo;s photorealistic 3-D models are created with the same software video-game designers use. Malhotra&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s thesis involves developing 3-D models and interactive animations of a dog&rsquo;s hind leg so veterinarians can learn how to perform a common surgery on dogs with hip dysplasia. Like many of her classmates, she&rsquo;s brushing up on her programming skills at UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), which pioneered several virtual-reality technologies. UIC&rsquo;s graduate biomedical visualization program is one of only four in the United States; Malhotra cites its partnership with the EVL as evidence that it&rsquo;s the most progressive. Malhotra finds that the program attracts students who are torn between art and science in college - many of them doctors&rsquo; kids, like herself, whose interest in medicine doesn&rsquo;t quite extend to medical school.<br><br>
