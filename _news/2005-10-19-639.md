Picture a wall of big-screen digital TV sets that create one giant image, nearly as picture-perfect as real life.<br><br>

Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago have developed such a 100-million-pixel display screen, measuring 17 feet wide and 8 feet tall, to help scientists work together more effectively to solve problems.<br><br>

The setup, called LambdaVision, uses software that graduate students created, and it enables scientists to transfer their research from their supercomputers and laptops onto the big screen.<br><br>

&ldquo;We believe that in the future, high-resolution screens will be so cheap, we&rsquo;ll be able to wallpaper our meeting rooms with them,&rsquo; said Jason Leigh, one of three directors at the university&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the West Side campus.<br><br>

&ldquo;In the past, such displays have been mainly used to show one big picture,&rdquo; said Luc Renambot, chief designer of the system&rsquo;s software and an assistant professor in the lab.<br><br>

The LambdaVision setup enables scientists to show graphics from their PCs, laptops, high-definition video and other sources onto different sections of the big wall. It generates the resolution scientists need to study things like models of the Earth&rsquo;s layers.<br><br>
