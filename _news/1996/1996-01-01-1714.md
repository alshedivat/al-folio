The &ldquo;Jaws of Death&rdquo; is a virtual reality torture chamber - a cacophony of sound and color which fully envelopes the participant in the CAVE&trade; virtual reality environment.<br><br>

This application was part of &ldquo;The Great Sandini Circus of the CAVE&trade;&rdquo;, which premiered at the EVE4 event in the Spring of 1995.
