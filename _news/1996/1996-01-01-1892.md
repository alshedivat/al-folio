Advanced Networking Research (ANR) has been a focus of EVL&rsquo;s work over the last decade. The ANR encompasses the development of an advanced network infrastructure, the investigation of photonic networks (the control plane of particular interest), network transport protocols, and the monitoring, maintenance and visualization of network performance.<br><br>

Current research is led by EVL co-Director and Computer Science Associate Professor, Jason Leigh, and Research Assistant Professor, Luc Renambot.
