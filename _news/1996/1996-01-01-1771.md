The development of the ImmersaDesk2&trade; system in 1996 focused upon a number of design issues not addressed by the initial ImmersaDesk&trade; system. The primary design goals of this system were to accommodate shipment by air, allow &ldquo;rapid&rdquo; deployment and accessibility.<br><br>

Essentially, the ImmersaDesk2&trade; is a dual purpose ImmersaDesk&trade; contained within a single large flight case. The press of a button activates the conversion of viewing angle from desk (45 degree) to vertical screen display, allowing for use as a traditional A-V presentation device, as well as an immersive virtual reality system. The display dimension is 83&rdquo; diagonal, 1.3 ratio, using a rear projected low gain screen. All mechanical articulations are aided and checked by gas struts. The chassis supports an Electrohome Marquee projector located between two 19&rdquo; rack bays, which house audio, tracker and stereo graphics systems. With minimal modifications, a deskside Onyx2 can be housed within the package. Ascension&rsquo;s SpacePad currently provides user&rsquo;s head and hand tracking, though alternative tracking solutions are being evaluated.<br><br>

The ImmersaDesk2 also uses the same CAVE&trade; library software as is used in the CAVE&trade;, to generate accurate perspective projection, and to read tracker and input devices. The CAVE&trade; software library is available from VRCO.<br><br>

The ImmersaDesk R2 system is the commercially available product from FakeSpace Systems Inc. derived from EVL&rsquo;s ImmersaDesk2&rsquo; prototype system.
