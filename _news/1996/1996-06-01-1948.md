Dream Grrrls is a real-time interactive CAVE&trade; virtual art environment created by Margaret Dolinsky and Grit Sehmisch.<br><br>

Dream Grrrls debuted at SIGGRAPH and is installed at the Ars Electronica Center in Linz, Austria.<br><br>

Dream Grrrls invites you to explore dreaming in a labyrinth. Discover paths that lead to whimsical worlds - where you can ride a see-saw in the clouds - be shaken when you look into the face of an unfamiliar psyche. Follow the voices in the air or let experience be the guide in a place where one can only expect the unexpected&hellip;
