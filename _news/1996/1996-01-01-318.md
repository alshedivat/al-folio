<em>Neither Here Nor There</em> was a compilation of virtual reality art work shown at the SIGGRAPH 96, Bridge Art Show, and The Digital Bayou venues.<br><br>

The <em>Bridge Art Show</em> consisted of a broad range of computer generated artwork and media, while <em>The Digital Bayou</em> emphasized highly interactive, cutting-edge graphics technologies and research projects; <em>Neither Here Nor There</em> addressed the focus of both venues.<br><br>

Applications that later became integrated into the shared context software environment, entitled <em>Oort Continuum</em> were shown individually at the event. <em>The Great Sandini Virtual Reality Circus</em>, <em>N.I.C.E.</em>, and <em>Vandalism</em> were also exhibited.<br><br>

In addition, <em>Vibrafloor</em>, a sonic wave floor constructed by Joe Reitzer - an adjunct assistant professor in UIC&rsquo;s School of Art and Design and an EVL MFA alumni - premiered at <em>The Digital Bayou</em>.
