This special issue, &ldquo;VR and the Net,&rdquo; focuses on supercomputing-to-VR and VR-to-VR communications over high-speed networks, enabling researchers to investigate solutions to complex problems over distance. Specifically, some of the applications featured in the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) Testbed event at the ACM / IEEE Supercomputing &rsquo;95 (SC &rsquo;95) conference in San Diego in December 1995 are described. Tom DeFanti, as SC &rsquo;95 Information Architect was responsible for all conference networking, audio/visual support, and the GII Testbed. Maxine Brown co-chaired the GII Testbed and Rick Stevens was chief architect of the experimental networking activities.
