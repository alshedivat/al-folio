&ldquo;Psychotunnel&rdquo;, a three-dimensional whirling vortex, transported participants to an abstract virtual world. It was one of a number of virtual attractions in &ldquo;The Great Sandini Circus of the CAVE&trade;&rdquo;, which premiered in the Spring of 1995 at the EVE4 event, Gallery 400, Chicago IL. It has also been shown at SIGGRAPH 96 and the Ars Electronica Festival &rsquo;96 in Linz, Austria.
