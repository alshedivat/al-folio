Mitologies is a collaborative virtual reality artwork for the CAVE&trade;. It is loosely based on the Cretan myth of the Minotaur, Dante&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inferno&rdquo;, the revelation of St. John, Durer&rsquo;s woodcuts after the revelation, and Borges&rsquo; Library of Babel. Mitologies derives from the Greek word &ldquo;mitos,&rdquo; the thread Ariadne gave Theseus to help him find his way out of the Cretan labyrinth.<br><br>

The participants in Mitologies re-experience allegorically Theseus&rsquo; journey, in an imaginary maze which experiments in combining this common element from different historical references. The connections between the above sources are central to the unfolding of the &ldquo;labyrinthine medieval narrative&rdquo; employed.
