&ldquo;Handprints&rdquo; (Spring &rsquo;96) is a work of interactive fiction which lives on the web. The first few pages establish the beginning of a narrative which is then left to the visitors to continue. A second story, contributed by Paul Brenner, was added to &ldquo;Handprints&rdquo; when it was exhibited at Gallery 312.
