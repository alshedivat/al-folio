The CAVE&trade; virtual reality roller coaster ride called &ldquo;Vomit Mountain&rdquo; allows the user to design a roller coaster by first flying around in the three-dimensional virtual space, then taking it for a test ride!<br><br>

&ldquo;Vomit Mountain&rdquo; was a virtual circus attraction as part of &ldquo;The Great Sandini Circus of the CAVE&trade;&rdquo;, which premiered at the EVE4 event in the Spring of 1995.
