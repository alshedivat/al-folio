## Gallery of Motions



![image](https://www.evl.uic.edu/output/originals/avatar1.gif){:style="max-width: 100%"}

A sculpture garden and gallery where even the plants and buildings move, with tours conducted by an animated guide. The garden is comprised of exhibits including kinetic objects based on the Philippine wine dance and three-dimensional harmonic motion, and knots that untie themselves. The gallery contains rooms where the participant can control snowstorms and be vacuumed by strange attractors.<br><br>

Gallery of Motions was showcased at SIGGRAPH &rsquo;96 in The Bridge Art Show.
