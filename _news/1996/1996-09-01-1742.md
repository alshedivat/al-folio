In <em>Dimension Land</em> a remotely located instructor uses a shared virtual environment and the three dimensions of VR to teach about hypercubes and 4D math.<br><br>

As a 3D box can be projected into 2D space, so a hyper-cube, the 4D cube, can be projected into 3D space. The students can experiment with this 3D projection.<br><br>

This application is part of an experiment that compares learning in a remote environment with a teacher who is:<br>
<ul>
<li>Physically present</li>
<li>A networked video presence</li>
<li>A networked VR avatar</li>
</ul><br>

Dimension World was built to evaluate how people communicate in virtual environments as part of Costigan&rsquo;s Masters Thesis in the Department of Communications.
