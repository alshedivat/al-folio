EVL has just announced the release of the 35 Panel Cylindrical Varrier&trade; Autostereo Display prototype.<br><br>

The Cylindrical Varrier&trade; display is a head-tracked autostereo virtual reality display that eliminates the need to wear special glasses to see the stereoscopic image. The prototype consists of 35 LCD panels tiled in a 7x5 configuration with a 6&rsquo;x8&rsquo; footprint. A photographic film barrier screen affixed to a glass panel is mounted to the front of each of the 21&rdquo; LCD panels.<br><br>
