P.O - 2.4 is a OpenGL / Inventor project based on a traditional painting that was exhibited as part of my BFA thesis project in 2000.<br><br>

P.O 2.4 is about real-time based movement of moving images. It explores the area of the vitality of space and movement generation spaces. I want to think about space as an action-oriented or a dynamic process. It was more intriguing to focus on the empty space, which each page generates as time passes, rather than the pages themselves.<br><br>

All cubes randomly move in real time and never are self-repetitive. They are based on a set of simple rules that create complex orders.
