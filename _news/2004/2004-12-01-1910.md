InterPlay: Loose Minds in a Box was a collaborative work that explored the basic characteristics of the &ldquo;box&rdquo;. The box served as a metaphor for the physical, social, political or psychological constraints that we and/or others project upon us. The box also represented a sense of place in the realm of the virtual as well as in our sub-conscience. With the aid of over twenty-six performance artists, electro-acoustic musicians / composers, virtual reality and motion capture artists / technologists and others, we examined the numerous representations the &ldquo;box&rdquo; encompasses.<br><br>

Artists in Salt Lake City UT, Fairbanks AK, Missoula MT, Chicago IL, West Lafayette IN and College Park MD simultaneously performed and transmitted their interpretations to the other sites and the Access Grid venue. In that venue, people from around the world could view the performances. At the host site in Salt Lake City, the director, coalesced more than twenty video streams from all six sites, mixed and processed them for the local audience and then streamed the processed videos back onto the internet for the audiences at other sites.<br><br>

InterPlay: Loose Minds in a Box premiered on April 15 - 17, 2005. In addition, it was performed at the ACM SIGGRAPH 2005 conference at the Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles, California on August 3 - 4, 2005 and at the Supercomputing Global 2005 Conference at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle, Washington on November 17, 2005. Presentations of the project were given at the International Federation of Theatre Research Conference at University of Maryland on June 26 - July 2, 2005 and the Humanities and Technology Conference at Snowbird, Utah on October 6 - 8, 2005.
