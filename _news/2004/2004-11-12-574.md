EVLers, Helen-Nicole Kostis and Tina Shah will be participating at this year&rsquo;s Artful Object event, <em>A Night of Art at Studio 74</em> held by the Oak Park Area Arts Council. Tina is donating a piece titled <em>Indian</em>, a digital print representing racial identity issues and Helen-Nicole&rsquo;s piece, titled <em>natural phenomena iii</em>, is a 3D render about the common, the ordinary and its beauty.<br><br>

It it was 30 years ago in 1974 that New York&rsquo;s &ldquo;Studio 54&rdquo; was the most famous nightclub in America. It was also the year the Oak Park Area Arts Council was established. The Foley-Rice Cadillac / Oldsmobile loft will be transformed into the place to SEE fabulous art, and BE SEEN by over 100 participating artists and those who support the arts in our community. The silent auction will include ceramics, jewelry, paintings, sculpture and more.<br><br>

The Arts Council holds Artful Object each year to raise money for two of its largest programs: ArtsFunds, the Council&rsquo;s granting program, and the Oak Park Area Arts Council Fine Arts Scholarship program to benefit college bound student artists who live in the tri-village area of Oak Park, Forest Park and River Forest.<br><br>

Tickets are $60 each for members of the Oak Park Area Arts Council and $75 each for non-members. Tickets will be $80 at the door or purchased after 11/5/04.
