&ldquo;3.D.UO.PAD&rdquo; is an interactive 3D sketchpad. With an immersive 3D display system such as CAVE or CWALL, the user can draw and carve using the virtual sketchpad.<br><br>

To select a brush color the user can click paint bucket to jump into 3D color space and select color by flying through color space. In color space, the user sees the color of the paint bucket interactively, and changes by responding to user&rsquo;s position. The user also can select and assign a 2D image as texture onto the sketchpad and morph the pad dynamically. Once the work is finished, the result can be saved and loaded in realtime.
