The StorySpace project studies the role new interface technologies might play in high school education. Unfortunately, technology often seizes center stage in the classroom, becoming itself the topic of instruction. We argue that learning in general and learning about technology in particular will be most successful when technology is used in the service of learning, rather than learning in the service of technology. Certainly, outside of the classroom, technology is rarely an end in itself;  application gives technology its power. The classroom should be no different.
