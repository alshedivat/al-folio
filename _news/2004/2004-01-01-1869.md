<em>eternal joy: no words</em><br>
video - 00.30 seconds<br><br>

<em>eternal joy: no words</em> is an experimental work which confronts Josephine&rsquo;s choice to travel inside and stay in a world between childhood and midlife. She desires this because it saves her spiritual and creative worlds. She is the eyes of a child; it is her choice, eternal joy, no words. Divine silence.<br><br>
