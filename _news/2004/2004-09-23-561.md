The 4th Workshop on Advanced Collaborative Environments (WACE 2004) will address research, technological and social issues of developing persistent collaboration infrastructure to address the needs of emerging scientific communities. The goal of the workshop is to provide an open technical forum to promote the discussion of high-end, high-value solutions to the problem of supporting distributed scientific collaboration.
