&ldquo;From lines of division and separation to nomadic &lsquo;lines of flight&rsquo; - lines that carry us away, a flow of deterritorialization&rdquo; - Deleuze<br><br>

&ldquo;The piece is about spaces construction. The time component activates and transforms these spaces by challenging our perception of boundaries - constantly shifting the boundaries causes space to become temporal. In this real-time animation I strived to create a notion of liquid architecture. The environment is generated by code that creates an on going changeable grid, and unstable structure in motion that the viewer can walk through.&rdquo; - Shirley Shor
