EVL is part of the OptIPuter project, which has a large presence at this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sc-conference.org/sc2004/">SC 2004</a> conference.<br><br>

The <a href="http://www.optiputer.net">OptIPuter</a>, so named for its use of Optical networking, Internet Protocol, computer storage, processing and visualization technologies, is an envisioned infrastructure that will tightly couple computational resources over parallel optical networks using the IP communication mechanism. The OptIPuter exploits a new world in which the central architectural element is optical networking, not computers - creating &ldquo;supernetworks&rdquo;. The goal of this new architecture is to enable scientists who are generating terabytes and petabytes of data to interactively visualize, analyze, and correlate their data from multiple storage sites connected to optical networks. Specifically, the OptIPuter&rsquo;s broad multidisciplinary team is conducting experiments with two data-intensive e-science efforts to ensure a useful and usable OptIPuter design: EarthScope efforts at the UCSD Scripps Institution of Oceanography, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN) efforts at the UCSD National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research, funded by the National Institutes of Health. Other groups, notably the USGS EDC and NASA, look to the OptIPuter project to provide the necessary leadership in developing and deploying next-generation affordable, interactive, large-scale display and Earth science analysis technologies. The OptIPuter receives major funding from NSF ITR cooperative agreement SCI-0225642 to UCSD.<br><br>
