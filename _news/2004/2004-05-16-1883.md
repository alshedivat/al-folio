CoreWall is an integrated visualization tool for the study of lake and ocean sediment cores. It is a collaborative project among the University of Illinois at Chicago&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), U.S. National Lacustrine Core Repository (LacCore) at the University of Minnesota, and the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) through Joint Oceanographic Institutions, a non-profit corporation located in Washington, D.C.<br><br>

CoreWall&rsquo;s software displays section images from one or more cores along with discrete data streams and nested images to provide a robust approach to the description of sediment cores. CoreWall creates virtual initial core description (ICD) sheets on-the-fly as data is added. This tool enables rapid multidisciplinary interpretation during the ICD process. Such interpretation is commonly done when preparing initial reports or papers for scientific journals.<br><br>

CoreWall&rsquo;s high-resolution tiled-LCD display format gives geoscientists a large-scale perspective, helpful in processing and comparing high-resolution digital line-scan images of cores measuring up to hundreds of feet long.<br><br>

Split-core surface images are the fundamental template of sediment descriptive work. Loaded horizontally and viewed in high resolution along a sliding plane, features such as lithologic variation, macroscopic grain size variation, bioturbation intensity, chemical composition and micropaleontology are easier to interpret and annotate.<br><br>

CoreWall users can interface to a database of core images and sensor logs, and also fetch data from remote CoreWall repositories. Future plans include linking to the JANUS Ocean Drilling Program database at Texas A&amp;M University.<br><br>

A prototype desktop environment for CoreWall is <a href='http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/pg2'>Personal GeoWall2</a> (PG2), a system that uses a single computer to drive four LCD panels as well as a single screen stereo GeoWall display. The combination allows geoscientists to juxtapose high-resolution core images and sensor data next to fully stereoscopic visualizations.
