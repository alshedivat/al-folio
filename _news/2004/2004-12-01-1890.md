LambdaCam is a real-time screen capture and distribution utility for cluster driven tiled-displays. It allows users to remotely view the output of cluster driven tiled-displays in real-time, using either a web-interface or through an OpenGL based utility. Thus, in essence, it acts akin to a web-cam pointed at the tiled display. This allows users to remotely monitor or present the output of a tiled-display even on a laptop.
