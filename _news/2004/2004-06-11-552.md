A year-long collaboration between artists from the US and Vietnam culminates in River of Many Sides. The metaphor of the river journey reflects our countries&rsquo; common history and how that history has shaped the identities of both.<br><br>

This compelling experience addresses concepts of cultural understanding using interactive computer systems and features live performers interacting with audio and visual environments. At key moments, the audience is invited to participate.<br><br>
