The interaction with computers and extremely complex data, exploring multi-sensorial channels (audition, touch, vision, temperature, sense of smell, etc), it is the tonic of the Festival of Virtual Worlds, that it is part of the activities to be accomplished during the VII Brazilian Symposium of Virtual Reality, creating a space popularization specific for that software modality.<br><br>

The festival includes all of the domains of application of the Virtual Reality and it classifies them in applications returned for Education, Science, Art, Technology, or Industry. It has as objective the development of the applied Virtual Reality to the several areas of the knowledge, stimulating the creativity, the innovation and the originality.<br><br>

<strong>V_Hive</strong><br>
V_Hive is CAVE-based, networked, virtual reality. Participants in South America, Europe, and North America link up to explore the different &ldquo;cells&rdquo; or virtual worlds. These worlds include PAAPAB, a virtual dance floor; Beat Box, an arena of virtual sound machines; Looking for Water, a shared watery experience; Rutopia, an ideal garden based visually on Russian folk art; Animagina, a technotopian / technopocalyptic conceptual environment; Yggdrasil, in which the user acts as a Nordic Ancient god; and Kites Flying In and Out of Space. Confluxus, an architectural portal, gives access to all the cells.<br><br>
