EVL faculty members Tom Moher and Andrew Johnson, along with UIC Distinguished Professor Jim Pellegrino are partners in the 3 year $6,000,000 NSF-funded <em>Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education Center for Learning and Teaching</em> Program, led by Principal Investigator Bob Chang of Northwestern University.<br><br>

The Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education (NSEE) Center for Learning and Teaching (NCLT) project entitled &ldquo;NCLT: A Center to Develop Nanoscale Science and Engineering Educators with Leadership Capabilities&rdquo; focuses on the research and development of nano-science instructional resources for grades 7-16, related professional development opportunities for 7-12 teachers, and programs infused with nano-science content for education doctoral students. The Center will bring together educators and scientists from several areas of nano-science and engineering research to collaborate with science teachers and doctoral candidates in education on both the development of the resources and research on their efficacy.<br><br>

Lead partners in the Center are Northwestern University, Purdue University, University of Michigan, University of Illinois at Chicago and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Additional partners include Argonne National Laboratory, West Point Military Academy, Alabama A &amp; M University, Fisk University, Hampton University, Morehouse College and University of Texas at El Paso. The additional partners will widen the geographic range of the project, expanding opportunities to reach a diverse and currently underrepresented population of graduate students, teachers and ultimately students. STEM, education faculty and researchers from the partner institutions will participate in interdisciplinary teams to address the Center&rsquo;s mission: provide national education leadership and resources for advancing NSEE;  create and implement professional development programs in NSEE; use innovative ideas in learning to design instructional materials for grades 7-16; and, conduct research relating to integration of NSEE into science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education.
