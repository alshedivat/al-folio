Once a year, Linz is the center of computer culture. The Ars Electronica Festival, established in 1979 to provide an open meeting-place for artists and researchers, has since developed into a world-famous forum for the arts, technology, and society. From the beginning, Ars Electronica has been characterized by its accessibility and its rejection of artificial frontiers. Jointly with the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) Upper Austria Regional Studio, it organizes symposiums, exhibitions, concerts, events, and a wealth of arts projects, and puts the latest trends and developments in the field of digital media on public display.<br><br>

<strong>Prix Ars Electronica - International Competition for Cyberarts</strong><br>
Since 1987 the Prix Ars Electronica is an interdisciplinary platform for all who use the computer as a universal design medium in their artistic endeavour. It has been awarded annually by the Ars Electronica Center and the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) Upper Austrian Studio in the framework of the Ars Electronica Festival, and is one of the most important prizes for the application of creativeness and the pioneering spirit in the field of digital media. The competition is divided into four categories: Net Vision / Net Excellence, Interactive Art, Computer Animation / Visual Effects, and Digital Music. A record 2,714 submissions from 85 countries in 2003 have further enhanced the Prix Ars Electronica&rsquo;s reputation as the internationally representative competition honoring outstanding work in the cyberarts. With an annual prize of more than 100.000, - Euro, it is the biggest award for computer art in the world.<br><br>

<strong>Ars Electronica Center - Museum of the Future</strong><br>
Since 1996, permanent exhibition areas on five levels of the Ars Electronica Center have been showcasing creative technologies and the innovative ideas of the 21st century to enable visitors to get acquainted with the technology of the future, gain hands-on experience with it and customize it to their needs, and interactively learn in a way that is fun, user-friendly, and designed with all visitors in mind, no matter what their level of computer experience. The facility&rsquo;s hardware and software, its presentation and seminar rooms, as well as the know-how of its staff make it a fascinating interface for art, business and research. Robotic planting and watering in the TeleGarden or a fantastic journey through virtual worlds in the CAVE are just a couple of the possibilities in store for visitors.<br><br>

<strong>Ars Electronica Futurelab - Laboratory for Future Innovations</strong><br>
Strongly committed to an interdisciplinary approach, the Ars Electronica Futurelab was created in 1996 and carries out R&amp;D projects that call for state-of-the-art design and highly innovative thinking. Since its very inception, Ars Electronica&rsquo;s focus has been on the tension and interplay at the nexus of art, technology and society. Formulating and implementing the future manifestations of this interaction is the chosen mission of the Ars Electronica Futurelab.<br><br>
