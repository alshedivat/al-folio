The Collaborative Visualization Center (CVC) at the University of California San Diego, Jacobs School of Engineering, Cal-(IT)<sup>2</sup> opens Wednesday, September 22nd, 4:00 - 7:00pm.<br><br>

The new facility is designed and modeled after EVL&rsquo;s &ldquo;Continuum&rdquo; project (advanced collaborative environment) - equipped with a state of the art display system, coupling a graphics workstation with high resolution projectors for active stereo 3D visualization. Advanced, high quality A/V components, a smartboard, video and audio teleconferencing units, and wireless data capture systems allow for flexible reconfiguration of the space to create a &ldquo;living lab&rdquo; for experimentation in visualization research to a diverse user community.<br><br>

Opening demonstrations will include a collaborative session between EVL and CVC, using the Immersaview software to share 3D data on immersive displays, while incorporating electronic whiteboards, audio and video transmissions.<br><br>

CVC is a joint Cal-(IT)<sup>2</sup> and Jacobs School research and presentation facility for artistic, scientific, and engineering disciplines.
