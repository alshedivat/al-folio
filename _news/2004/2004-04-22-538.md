EVL is participating in the Ninth Annual UIC&rsquo;s Daughters @ Work Day, Thursday, April 22. The event, organized by the Office of Women&rsquo;s Affairs, was inspired by the National Take Our Daughters to Work Day founded by the Ms. Foundation to help combat the dramatic decrease in career aspirations and self esteem that happens in girls ages 9-15. The goal of UIC&rsquo;s Daughters @ Work Day is to provide the girls with positive work role models, to expose them to a variety of career possibilities, and to showcase UIC as a place to pursue an education or career.<br><br>

As an &ldquo;I Can Do That!&rdquo; tour site, EVL women provide a tour of the laboratory, including the BAT CAVE and C-Wall, and hold a brief question / answer session.
