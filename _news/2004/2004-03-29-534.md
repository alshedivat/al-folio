<strong>Portable, Augmented, and Autostereo: EVL&rsquo;s Next Generation of Virtual Reality Displays</strong><br><br>

In March 2004, the Electronic Visualization Laboratory hosted an open house in conjunction with the IEEE VR 2004 conference. On exhibit were various scientific and artistic applications running on EVL-invented display systems, including PARIS, GeoWall, C-Wall and a 2000 lumen projector CAVE (shown here).<br><br>

The EVL open house event will also mark the debut of the Varrier autostereo system. Presentations on laboratory research projects will run concurrently.<br><br>
