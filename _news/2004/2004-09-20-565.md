EVL&rsquo;s Venkatram Vishwanath and Raj Vikram Singh will be presenting their research for Juxtaview and Teravision, respectively, at the IEEE Cluster 
Computing 2004 conference.<br><br>

Cluster 2004, held in San Diego, provides an open forum for researchers, practitioners, and users to present and discuss issues, directions, and results that will shape the future of cluster computing.<br><br>

Today, commodity clusters provide a convenient and cost-effective platforms for executing complex computation-, data-, and/or transaction-oriented applications. To achieve higher performance, scalability, and usability, research, and development challenges remain in virtually all areas of cluster computing, including middleware, networking, algorithms and applications, resource management, platform deployment and maintenance, and integration with grid computing.
