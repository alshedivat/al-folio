<a href='http://www.evl.uic.edu/luc/Research/LambdaVision/'>LambdaVision</a> is an ultra-high-resolution visualization and networking instrument for research and education in geoscience, computer science and other research disciplines.  LambdaVision consists of 55 LCD panels tiled to produce a 100Mpixel display.<br><br>

LambdaVision supports collaboration among co-located and remote experts requiring interactive ultra-high-resolution imagery, and investigates means to advance both science and public safety as validated by users in various disciplines of earth science research, and training exercises in disaster response and crisis management.<br><br>

LambdaVision is also developing adjunct wireless and camera-tracked instrumentation to facilitate interaction among users to help deploy emergency services where needed. LambdaVision entails a tenfold push of applied visualization and networking technology.<br><br>

The Broader Impact of LambdaVision is exemplified in the geoscience community&rsquo;s need for ultra high resolution display systems and viewers that can handle extremely large data sets that are stored on remote data servers.<br><br>
