The <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu">MIT Media Laboratory</a> was founded by MIT Professor Nicholas Negroponte and the late Jerome Wiesner, who foresaw the coming convergence of computing, publishing, and broadcast, fueled by changes in the communications industry. As this convergence accelerated, it spurred interconnected developments in the unusual range of disciplines that the Laboratory brought together, including cognition, electronic music, graphic design, video, and holography, as well as work in computation and human-machine interfaces.<br><br>

Helen-Nicole Kostis presents the concept for the Media Laboratory and the visionary insights of the digital future, as they were unraveled by the director of the Laboratory, Nicholas Negroponte, in <em>Being Digital</em>, in 1995. Almost ten years after the book&rsquo;s publication, it is both mentally rewarding and informative to review some of the projections, their current status, and future.
