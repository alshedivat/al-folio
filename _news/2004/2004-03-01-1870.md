Dinner at the Fairy Castle is an experimental project aimed at low cost alternatives to keying in actors in traditional movie sets. Using a virtual set, one can cut costs in regards to renting space, furniture, general labor and much more. With skilled artists, one can achieve the right look of a set - color, lighting, prop placement - with less production time!<br><br>

Dinner at the Fairy Castle: A Virtual Set, is an attempt to recreate the dining room of the Fairy Castle exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago. Since the actual exhibit is miniature in size, the artists thought it would be fun for audience participants to actually see themselves keyed inside one of the famous elegant rooms of the castle. Through windows of the virtual dining room, the participant can see live video of people peeking into the room! Dinner at the Fairy Castle: A Virtual Set brings the essence of the MSI exhibit into virtual reality.
