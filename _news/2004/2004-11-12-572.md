On Saturday, November 12th from 5:00 - 8:00pm an Opening Reception will be held for Beth Cerny Pati&ntilde;o&rsquo;s MFA Thesis Exhibition, <em>Community</em>.<br><br>

<em>Community</em> is about people interacting with each other in a multi-user, networked environment and creating collaborative artwork that changes over time. The participants draw and place icons in a shared workspace as their actions are broadcasted to the others in real-time. As time moves on, the imagery created by the participants slowly fades out allowing new marks to resonant. The participants can print their collaborative artwork capturing a moment in time.
