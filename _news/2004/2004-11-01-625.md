On Wednesday Pat Badani will discuss her project in progress: &ldquo;Where are you from&rdquo;, currently in its second phase of development. The work, for which she received a Canada Council Media Arts Research Grant, explores the convergence of technological and social space in six urban centers in the Americas and Europe in order to capture and disseminate cultural information. Badani will sketch a genealogy of media practices that are a backdrop for the project, and speculate on how the archived material can be reprocessed for the production of knowledge through methods of visualization and interactivity.
