EVL affiliated faculty member and Computer Science Assistant Professor Sidharth Kumar and his graduate students Landon Dyken and Will Usher are recognized with the Best Paper Award at the 13th IEEE Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization. This year&rsquo;s LDAV 2023 focus is on Big Data Analysis and Visualization, specifically targeting methodological innovation, algorithmic foundations, and possible end-to-end solutions.<br><br>
&ldquo;Speculative Progressive Raycasting for Memory Constrained Isosurface Visualization of Massive Volumes&rdquo; (Usher, W., Dyken, L., Kumar, S.) proposes a new GPU algorithm for implicit isosurface rendering that progressively traverses rays through the volume and decompresses data on-demand to minimize its memory footprint. Up to 5.7× reductions in overall memory use and 8.4× reductions in data decompressed compared to the state of the art in memory constrained isosurface extraction is acheived, without sacrificing interactivity. At 1280×720, the Richtmyer-Meshkov averages 264ms per-pass and 1.2s total on an RTX 3080.<br><br>
Congratulations team!
