## Using Virtual Reality For Machine Design

Caterpillar, Inc. uses virtual reality as a tool for interactively evaluating new machine designs. Using virtual reality, the operator of a virtual machine can test alternative machine designs while driving through a virtual proving ground, or can perform a loading cycle to fill a truck with soil. Hydraulically-actuated tools can be assessed with various hydraulic systems.<br><br>

Using a virtual-reality system enables engineers and designers to get a &ldquo;feel&rdquo; for their machine designs very early in the design stage, helping them evaluate many different designs in shorter periods of time than possible using conventional methods.<br><br>

This application was a part of VROOM - the Virtual Reality Room event showcased at SIGGRAPH 94.
