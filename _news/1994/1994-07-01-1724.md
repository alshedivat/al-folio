This autobiographical account by artist Rita Addison describes perceptual changes she experienced subsequent to her head injury in a car accident. DETOUR uses computer brain models and medical imaging to demonstrate anatomical trauma. In the final section, Addison&rsquo;s pre-accident photographic art is reconfigured to simulate the perceptual damage she sustained.<br><br>

A virtual-reality experience can be a powerful way to evoke and stretch empathic capabilities. Whether it is used in collaborative medical evaluations or to educate medical professionals, students, patients, and families, virtual-reality technology is a unique and invaluable tool for communication.<br><br>

This application was a part of VROOM - the Virtual Reality Room event showcased at SIGGRAPH 94.
