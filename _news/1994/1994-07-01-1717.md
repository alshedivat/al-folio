This project uses transient nonlinear finite element analysis to model the crash-worthiness of a vehicle modified from gasoline to electric power. The modification changes the dynamic structural response of the vehicle during a collision, and designers must ensure occupant safety as the vehicle components undergo plastic deformation. Finite element models allow investigation of the deformed geometry and buckling patterns of the vehicle over a series of time steps. They also permit examination of key response quantities such as effective stress and effective plastic strain.<br><br>

This application was a part of VROOM - the Virtual Reality Room event showcased at SIGGRAPH 94.
