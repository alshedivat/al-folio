&ldquo;The Great Sandini Virtual Reality Circus of the CAVE&trade;&rdquo; was originally created for EVL&rsquo;s EVE4 presentation in Spring 1995; this premiere also marked EVL graduate student Jim Barr&rsquo;s MFA Thesis show. An updated version of this CAVE&trade; experience showed at SIGGRAPH 96, the opening of the Ars Electronica Center, and at the Total Museum Conference.<br><br>

&ldquo;The Circus&rdquo; environment consisted of several virtual &ldquo;attractions&rdquo;. Participants traveled through a virtual midway and visited &ldquo;tents&rdquo; containing circus-like experiences along the way. &ldquo;The Circus&rdquo; was a collaborative effort whereby developers from art &amp; design and computer science disciplines created a single attraction or &ldquo;tent&rdquo; within the virtual environment.<br><br>

The attractions included the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>The Food Court</li>
<li>Jack in the Box</li>
<li>Jaws of Death</li>
<li>Haunted House</li>
<li>PsychoTunnel</li>
<li>Leakey&rsquo;s Room</li>
<li>Vomit Mountain</li>
</ul>
