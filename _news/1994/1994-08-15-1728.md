<em>Vandalism</em> is an interactive virtual environment for the CAVE&trade; and ImmersaDesk&trade; VR systems.<br><br>

<em>Vandalism</em> was created as part of <em>Neither Here Nor There</em>, a collection of CAVE / ImmersaDesk&trade; applications shown at SIGGRAPH &rsquo;96, in <em>The Bridge and the Digital Bayou</em>. It was also a part of the opening of the Ars Electronica Center, at the Ars Electronica Festival &rsquo;96.
