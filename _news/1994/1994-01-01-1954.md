<em>CitySpace</em> is an educational networking project that invites students to build a virtual city model made up of 3D objects and images from sites around the world.<br><br>

The CitySpace project strives to present a learning model based on collaboration, simulation, visualization, and wide-area digital networking. The project is intended for integration into project-based curricula and is designed for self-managing groups of students, mentors, teachers, and resource administrators.<br><br>

The model relies on a flexible, open, high-speed network based on client-server technology, widespread access to desktop digital media production tools, and efficient utilization of high-end computational resources.<br><br>

This application was a part of VROOM - the Virtual Reality Room event showcased at SIGGRAPH 94 and was also demonstrated at Supercomputing &rsquo;95.
