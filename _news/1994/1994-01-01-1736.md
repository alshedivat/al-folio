<em>The Oort Continuum</em> is a virtual reality application designed for the CAVE&trade;, based on the CAT (CAVE All Terrain) shared context software environment written by Marcus Thiebaux. CAT integrated several independent virtual environments into a single application. The resultant &ldquo;cosmic collaboration&rdquo; is explored by users traveling around the virtual Oort Cloud ring and teleporting to various virtual environments.<br><br>

<em>Jupiter Junction</em> by Marcus Thiebaux allows users to explore the solar system without size limitation.<br><br>

Margaret Watson&rsquo;s, <em>Artica Intergalaxia</em> presents a virtual celestial gallery, immersing the visitors in a meditation of organic substances exhibited in fantastical architectural spaces.<br><br>

<em>Dream Grrrls</em> by Margaret Dolinsky and Grit Sehmisch invites users to explore dreaming in a labyrinth.  Where they can discover paths that lead to whimsical worlds to ride a see-saw in the clouds or be captured by an animated vessel that shakes you into another world.<br><br>

The sculpture gardens and spaces within &ldquo;The Gallery of Motion&rdquo; take visitors through surreal mathematical landscapes and structures, where kinetic objects, snowstorms, strange attractors and knots can be explored.<br><br>

<em>Push / Pop</em> by Tom Coffin presents a virtual art space where black and white images are portals into alternative virtual worlds, where there is neither a top or bottom, up or down - and gravity does not exist. Coffin&rsquo;s collaboration with Gary Minnix, &ldquo;Yes Maybe No&rdquo; explores 2-dimensional images and photographs collaged in 3-space.<br><br>

Alan Cruz&rsquo;s and KaLeung Jark&rsquo;s <em>Aquasphere</em> allows participants to experience a virtual dive into the ancient ruins of Atlantis, while encountering unusual aquatic life along the way.<br><br>

The Oort showed at SIGGRAPH 96, the opening of the Ars Electronica Center in Linz, Austria, and at the Total Museum Conference in Chicago, IL.
