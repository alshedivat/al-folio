Scientific databases contain enormous amounts of data collected through experimentation. They are accessed by investigators from many disciplines, most of whom are unfamiliar with databases and their associated query languages.<br><br>

Using the SANDBOX, an investigator places virtual instruments into a virtual reenactment of the original experiment and collects data from the scientific database in much the same way that the original data were collected.<br><br>

This prototype of the SANDBOX allows an investigator to access parts of NASA&rsquo;s FIFE scientific database, which contains data from ground experiments, airborne instruments, and satellite photographs for developing ways to measure surface climatology from satellite information.<br><br>

This application was a part of VROOM - the Virtual Reality Room event showcased at SIGGRAPH 94.
