This project demonstrates the design of an anatomically realistic computer model of a human eye in a virtual environment. Users are able to explore and interact with the eye&rsquo;s components to discover their characteristics. The model will eventually be used to educate students on the eye&rsquo;s geometry and will allow them to simulate common pre-surgical procedures.<br><br>

This application was part of VROOM - the Virtual Reality Room event showcased at SIGGRAPH 94.
