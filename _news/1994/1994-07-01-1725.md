This demonstration models the Apteronotus Leptorhynchus (commonly known as the Brown Ghost). It displays simulated data of the electric fields emitted by the fish, as well as how the fields are distorted by an object placed in the surrounding water.<br><br>

The purpose of this fish simulation is to establish an understanding of how emissions are generated by the real fish. Since humans do not have an electric sense, it is difficult to comprehend how fish electric fields &ldquo;feel&rdquo;. Alternative techniques, such as virtual reality, must be used to acquire some of that sensation. The results will help us understand how this fish uses phase and amplitude information from the electric organ discharge for electrolocation and communication.<br><br>

This application was a part of VROOM - the Virtual Reality Room event showcased at SIGGRAPH 94.
