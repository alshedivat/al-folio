<em>Leaky&rsquo;s Room</em> is a virtual environment, developed by Keith Beu, that uses audience participation and real-time video and was created as a component of <em>The Great Sandini Virtual Circus of the CAVE&trade;</em> virtual environment.<br><br>

The audience entered <em>Leaky&rsquo;s Room</em>by falling through a trap door in the floor of a virtual circus tent. A short tunnel ride later, the participant would land in the &ldquo;hall of mirrors&rdquo; itself where live video of the viewers would be distorted in real-time and displayed back in the CAVE&trade;. This provided a &ldquo;house-of-mirrors&rdquo;-type effect, where the audience would see themselves distorted as if in a circus fun-house mirror. The live video feed of the viewers was distorted in real-time through use of Beu&rsquo;s proprietary <a href='http://www.evl.uic.edu/beu/IMGPROS/imageProcessing.html'>image processing tools</a>.
