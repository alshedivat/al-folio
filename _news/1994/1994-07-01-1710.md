Interactive 3D visualization has proved its value for finding and understanding problems with numerical simulations of the atmosphere. Scientists are able to scan through large simulations quickly, looking for problems, and then trace back through simulated time to find the root causes of those problems by comparing different model fields and looking at the geometry of those fields from various angles.<br><br>

This project demonstrates the current two-day forecast of Florida weather, made with the UW-NMS modeling system and visualized using the VIS-5D software. Virtual reality is used to present the high spatial and temporal resolution of numerical weather forecasts.<br><br>

This application was a part of VROOM - the Virtual Reality Room event showcased at SIGGRAPH 94.
