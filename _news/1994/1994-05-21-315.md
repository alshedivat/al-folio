&ldquo;The File Room&rdquo; is an illustrated archive of cases of cultural censorship on the web. Initiated by the artist Antonio Muntadas and produced by Randolph Street Gallery, &ldquo;The File Room&rdquo; was presented both as a public interactive installation at the Chicago Cultural Center from May to September of 1994 and as a continuous web server.<br><br>

EVL faculty and students coordinated and developed the web-based part of the archive, as well as the installation setup at the Chicago Cultural Center, which was visited by approximately 80,000 people.
