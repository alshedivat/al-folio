High-performance algorithms for simulating and visualizing 3D plasma turbulence in magnetic fusion experiments have been developed as an aid in the development of more accurate predictive models of plasma transport and the design of future experiments. This work is part of the Numerical Tokamak Project, a national consortium of efforts using the most powerful super- computers in the world to develop and use such numerical models. Virtual reality represents a &ldquo;next step&rdquo; in the development of a visualization system already in use by collaborators in the Numerical Tokamak Project.<br><br>

This application was a part of VROOM - the Virtual Reality Room event showcased at SIGGRAPH 94.
