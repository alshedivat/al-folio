The <em>Jack-in-the-Box</em> application grew out of a desire to create something fun and active in a virtual environment, and was originally designed as an element in Jim Barr&rsquo;s <em>The Great Sandini Virtual Reality Circus</em>.<br><br>

This application, like a shooting gallery, lets the CAVE&trade; guest shoot missiles at a moving target. The target is a Jack-in-the-Box that springs up, then bobs crazily waiting to be hit. The &ldquo;wand&rdquo; is used to shoot snowballs at the jack heads. When the jacks are successfully hit they complain.<br><br>

This application uses a grab-bag of graphical techniques to make the jacks look and behave dynamically and realistically. The body is a single spring chain length. The head bobbing is achieved using a quaternion aligned along the last few lengths of the spring chain. The head is a displaced sphere; the displacement is a function of the green component of an RBG image. The image is also texture mapped onto the deformed sphere. The image has two functions - providing the shape and color of the head. The snowballs and yellow &ldquo;sparkles&rdquo; are based on particle systems.
