The virtual reality environment <em>Food Court</em>, a circus attraction within a virtual tent of <em>The Great Sandini Virtual Reality Circus</em>, allowed participants to select various tasty circus treats and feed them to the giant undulating 3-D tongues!<br><br>

<em>The Great Sandini Virtual Reality Circus</em> was a collaboration between several EVL graduate students, under the direction of Jim Barr. It premiered at the EVE4 event in the Spring of 1995 and subsequently at SIGGRAPH 96, Ars Electronica and the Total Museum Conference.
