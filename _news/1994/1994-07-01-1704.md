Adaptive mesh refinement / derefinement techniques have been shown to be very successful in reducing the computational and storage requirements for solving many partial differential equations. This project focuses on the Rivara bisection technique, which is suitable for use on unstructured triangular meshes such as those used in finite-element calculations.<br><br>

Virtual reality demonstrates the realization of interactive adaptive mesh refinement. A user indicates the areas of the mesh to be refined using a 3D wand in the virtual space. This interaction is especially desirable in three dimensions, where users are immersed inside the mesh to locate interior regions that require refinement.<br><br>

This application was a part of VROOM - the Virtual Reality Room event showcased at SIGGRAPH 94.
