<em>Artica Intergalaxia</em> is an intergalactic gallery containing an exhibition of virtual reality art entitled <em>Amorphous Cubes</em>.<br><br>

The idea behind the exhibition space was to create a virtual experience for the viewer / user not only in viewing the art work, but also by creating a journey to each one of the four works of art.<br><br>

Because virtual art work is of a spatial nature, icons of the four works of art are exhibited in individual temples.<br><br>

The type of architecture was chosen to create a space in which viewers subconsciously are aware that they are within a gallery setting. The creation of the architecture in space places a known and familiar structure in a setting that could not ordinarily exist in reality.<br><br>

<em>Artica</em> was exhibited publicly, both on video and on an ImmersaDesk, at SIGGRAPH 96 in New Orleans. At SIGGRAPH, it was shown on video in the Computer Animation Festival.<br><br>

As a virtual environment, it was part of a collaborative EVL exhibit entitled <em>Neither Here Nor There</em> that was shown in both <em>The Digital Bayou</em> and <em>The Bridge Art Show</em>. For this exhibit, it was shown both as an individual work, but also as a part of CAT (CAVE&trade; All Terrain), a shared context software environment that integrated several VR Projects at EVL into one application.<br><br>

The CAT project, entitled <em>The Oort Continuum</em>, was created as the opening exhibition for the CAVE&trade; at the Ars Electronica Center (AEC).<br><br>

The AEC CAVE&trade; opened during the Ars Electronica Festival in 1996. The <em>The Oort Continuum</em> continues to be a part of AEC&rsquo;s permanent collection.
