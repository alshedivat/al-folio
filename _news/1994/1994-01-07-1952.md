Using feature-based 3D metamorphosis allows the operator to treat 3D geometry the same way as 2D image: identifying features of the object enables it&rsquo;s manipulation.<br><br>

Metamorphosis could be done with one object (warping) or with two, where the transformation of one into another is created. The CAVE&trade; virtual environment was chosen for animator&rsquo;s interface because it provides the most intuitive way of selecting features in corresponding objects and for viewing results.
