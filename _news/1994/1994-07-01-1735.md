The JASON is an underwater remotely operated vehicle operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. This virtual-reality demonstration re-enacts the exploration of hydrothermal vents in the Guaymas Basin near Baja California. CAVE participants watch the JASON as it collects bathymetry data, temperature data, and high-resolution still images, and transmits a &ldquo;live feed&rdquo; from its video cameras (pre-recorded, in this case, for presentation purposes).<br><br>

With a virtual-reality interface, users are able to visit this normally inaccessible region via telepresence.
