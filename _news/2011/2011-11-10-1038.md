Organized by UIC New Media Arts, associate professor Daniel Sauter, Mobile Processing brings together internationally recognized innovators from the open source software community, startup companies, students, and scholars, from areas such as Art and Design, Computer Science, Communication, and Information Sciences. The 2nd edition features a series of lectures, workshops, and presentations, all free and open to the public (workshops require prior registration). A new addition to the conference is the Chicago Processing Forum, featuring Chicago-based projects and companies using the open source Processing environment.<br><br>

Keynote speaker Ben Fry, winner of the 2011 National Cooper-Hewitt Design Award, will present the first release of Processing 2.0, and its new modes now targeting Android devices and JavaScript-powered web apps.

Currently, more than 70,000 individuals use Processing on a regular basis. Processing is free to download, open source and cross-platform.<br><br>
