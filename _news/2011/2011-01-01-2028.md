In an homage to &ldquo;StarTrek,&rdquo; EVL graduate student Arthur Nishimoto spent his spare time over the past two years creating a 3D virtual replica of the starship Enterprise.  Participants can wander through various rooms inside the ship, and then exit the ship to explore the docking station. Nishimoto created all interior room models, and ported the Enterprise&rsquo;s exterior model, developed by Dennis Baily and converted to Blender by Eric Clark, to the CAVE2&trade; System. EVL&rsquo;s OmegaLib software is used to display the 3D model in the CAVE2.<br><br>
