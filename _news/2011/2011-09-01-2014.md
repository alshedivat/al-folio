<strong>Spaced Out</strong> uses a NeuroSky MindWave and Unity3d to generate a model of the Solar System affected by brain waves. Solar flares are triggered by high attention, time slows down with high meditation, alpha waves change the size of Saturn&rsquo;s rings, delta waves set the cloud density of Venus, and theta wave spikes sends comets toward the sun.<br><br>

This project uses a Hyundai 3D tiled display, Vicon tracking system, the Nintendo Wii for interaction, and surround audio.
