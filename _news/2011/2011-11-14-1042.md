SAGE, the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment, is a graphics streaming architecture that enables users to interactively access, display and share a variety of data-intensive information, in a variety of resolutions and formats, from multiple sources, with the same ease that the Web affords for accessing lower-resolution objects today. This BOF session provides an opportunity for the SAGE global user community - current users as well as potential users - to meet, discuss current and future development efforts, and share examples of community-developed use cases and applications. SAGE is a three-year project (2009-2012) funded by the National Science Foundation to create persistent visualization and collaboration services for global cyberinfrastructure, and is currently deployed at 78 major centers, institutions and research laboratories worldwide.<br><br>
