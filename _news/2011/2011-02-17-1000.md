The CEO of <a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/">Seagate Technology</a>, a leading provider of data storage devices, happened to be watching television one night a few weeks ago and saw Jason Leigh&rsquo;s profile on the NOVA scienceNOW episode of &ldquo;Can We Live Forever?&rdquo;. Duly impressed, Seagate CEO Steve Luczo emailed Leigh, director of the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) and professor of Computer Science, saying, &ldquo;I saw a program about you on NOVA. I think what you are doing is amazing and I would like to support you with disc drives, as I&rsquo;m sure your applications are storage intensive. No strings attached.&rdquo;<br><br>

Leigh requested five storage servers that have a total capacity of 60 Terabytes and a list price of $9,000, which are now on their way to Chicago. Only then did Luczo ask if, when next in Chicago, he could visit EVL and see firsthand the Lab&rsquo;s avatar work. Leigh said he was more than welcome, but added, &ldquo;&hellip;the avatar stuff is only about 10% of what I actually do - but you gotta see it to believe it.&rdquo;<br><br>
