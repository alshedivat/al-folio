EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: I&rsquo;ve heard from several people who were delighted to learn about the retrospective art show &ldquo;Synthesis: Processing and Collaboration&rdquo; that showcased the early days of the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory - when it was actually called the Circle Graphics Habitat. Although the retrospective has now closed at UCSD, there is a wealth of documentation from the exhibition that traces EVL&rsquo;s almost 40-year history. There is also documentation of Dan Sandin&rsquo;s latest virtual-reality StarCAVE piece, &ldquo;Particle Dreams in Spherical Harmonics.&rdquo;<br><br>

For a trip down memory lane and an excellent documentary of the major role that the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory has played in advancing the new media arts, see:<br><br>
