EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: Last week the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory introduced a 3D version of its popular Cyber-Commons&rsquo; technology-enhanced classroom and meeting room, developed in collaboration with Planar Systems, using 3-D ultra-thin border, flat-panel displays. On November 16, 2011, UIC NEWS published the article &ldquo;Learning in 3-D,&rdquo; which includes recent photos of our new 3D wall.<br><br>

LEARNING IN 3D<br>

The Cyber-Commons displays form a cinematic blackboard that Leigh describes as &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; in its use. Anyone in the room with a laptop or tablet device can wirelessly grab space on the Cyber-Commons wall and simultaneously display multiple images, from documents to videos.<br><br>

Users can call up stored images, positioning and sizing them with their fingers on a touch-sensitive display surface. They can work in real time with others around the world, using high-performance networks and EVL-developed software called SAGE - Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment.<br><br>

&ldquo;3-D is more than Hollywood gimmickry,&rdquo; says Jason Leigh, professor of computer science and director of UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory. &ldquo;Humans understand information much more effectively in 3-D.&rdquo;<br><br>
