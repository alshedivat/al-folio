The Winter 2010 edition of the UIC Alumni News magazine profiled MS &rsquo;94 Engineering student Mike Papka in the article &ldquo;Hard Wired&rdquo; by Sara Langen. Papka is associate laboratory director for computing, environment and life sciences at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) as well as co-director of the Futures Laboratory in the Mathematics and Computer Science Division. He is also a senior fellow at the ANL / University of Chicago Computation Institute.<br><br>

EVL is proud to call Papka one of its own. As a computer science graduate student, he was an EVL research assistant working in the areas of scientific visualization and virtual reality - a passion that continues today. His deep interest in science (his undergraduate degree is in physics) and high-performance computing recently led to his assuming yet another position at ANL, that of Division Director of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF).<br><br>

Over the years, Papka continues to collaborate with EVL and has hired some of the Lab&rsquo;s best and brightest to join the ANL staff. He values the education he received at UIC, and hopes to someday teach more, particularly undergraduates, to imbue then with an appreciation for high-end computing infrastructure and its use in scientific discovery.
