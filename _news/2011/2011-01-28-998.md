It is time to join the 21st Century, so EVL has created a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/UIC.EVL">Facebook group: UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory</a>. It is *open* to everyone (students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends).<br>
<ul>
<li>Please join, and tell your EVL friends and classmates to join.</li>
<li>Post news about your career and possible career opportunities.</li>
<li>Post old photos of EVL and classmates.</li>
</ul><br>

EVL announcements will continue to be broadcast to the [EVL-NEWS] email list as well as posted on Facebook. Facebook, however, provides an opportunity for you to comment and add information of your own.<br><br>

EVL was founded in 1973 when Tom DeFanti arrived at UIC and started his life-long partnership with Dan Sandin. In a recent article about their new show <em><a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=4&amp;indi=738">Synthesis: Processing and Collaboration</a></em>, when asked how long they have been collaborating, Tom responded &ldquo;Thirty-seven-point five [years]&hellip; Three-eights of a century exactly.&rdquo; Throughout those years, EVL has had a big impact on many people&rsquo;s lives, and many people have contributed to EVL&rsquo;s successes. Facebook gives us an opportunity to capture testimonials of years past, and to provide a forum to inspire and mentor new students for generations to come. Please join!<br><br>

We look forward to seeing how this social networking experiment evolves!
