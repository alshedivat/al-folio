Students at the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) received recognition in both the Honorable Mention and Finalist categories for The Image of Research 2011, an annual interdisciplinary exhibit competition to showcase the breadth and diversity of research at UIC.<br><br>

EVL students JD Pirtle, Arthur Nishimoto, Karan Chakrapani, Todd Silvia, and Philip Pilosi, who represent undergraduate and graduate students in both computer science and new media arts, received Honorable Mention for <em>20 Foot Canvas</em>. The project pays homage to traditional painting, enabling artists to paint on a large-scale digital &ldquo;canvas&rdquo; by touching the wall with fingers or traditional brushes. Using an iPad, artists may select and mix colors as a painter would on a traditional painter&rsquo;s pallet.<br><br>

EVL student Ed Kahler, a computer science graduate student, was a Finalist for <em>Cli-Mate,</em> an interactive application that allows climate scientists to view and analyze their data in a multi-touch environment.<br><br>

An exhibit featuring the winners and the finalists is currently on display in the lobby of the UIC Daley Library. The winning entries are also on  exhibit in the Library of Health Sciences and featured on light pole banners around campus.<br><br>

The fourth annual Image of Research competition marks continued recognition of EVL student work since the contest&rsquo;s inception.<br><br>
