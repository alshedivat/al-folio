<em>A recent story by Northwestern University Medill School graduate student Frank Jackson III who spent his 4-day practicum at UIC / EVL in February 2011.</em><br><br>

FEBRUARY 18, 2011 - The Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) began developing the OmegaDesk last year, which employs three-dimensional visualizations, multi-touch functionality and motion sensor technology that act in concert for a new data experience. The OmegaDesk is the &ldquo;workspace of the future,&rdquo; said graduate researcher Arthur Nishimoto, because it allows for data to be visualized in multiple ways, as well as manipulated simultaneously. This work is supported by a major grant from the National Science Foundation.<br><br>
