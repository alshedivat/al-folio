Seamlessly-tiled LCD flat-screen displays stretching floor-to-ceiling and wall-to-wall at the University of Illinois at Chicago&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory &ldquo;Cyber-Commons&rdquo; has served as a digitally-enhanced way to display, manipulate and exchange information and images since its opening in 2009. On November 11, EVL demonstrates Cyber-Commons&rsquo; latest enhancement - three-dimensional imagery, displayed along with traditional 2-D images.<br><br>

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very powerful way to communicate ideas,&rdquo; said Jason Leigh, UIC-EVL director and professor of computer science. &ldquo;It lets people work together, make sense of lots of information and hopefully derive insights quicker. We&rsquo;ve found it changes the way students work together.&rdquo;<br><br>

The Cyber-Commons flat-screen displays are tiled on the wall to form a nearly cinematic classroom blackboard that Leigh describes as &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; in its use. Anyone in the room with a laptop or tablet device such as an iPad can wirelessly grab space on the Cyber-Commons wall and simultaneously display multiple images from documents to videos. Users can also call up stored images, positioning and sizing them with their fingers on a touch-sensitive display surface. That&rsquo;s made possible by EVL-developed software called SAGE - Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment - which also enables Cyber-Commons 3-D, or CC3D, to link via high-performance networks for real-time collaboration with facilities around the world.<br><br>

&ldquo;CC3D puts 2-D and 3-D on the same screen at the same time,&rdquo; said Maxine Brown, EVL&rsquo;s associate director. CC3D will initially use passive stereo technology to view 3-D. While passive stereo requires special glasses, they&rsquo;re not expensive like active stereo glasses that cost around $100, now used with consumer 3-D TV sets. &ldquo;Our glasses cost less than $1,&rdquo; said Brown, who thinks it&rsquo;ll be a few years before &ldquo;auto-stereo&rdquo; technology - which doesn&rsquo;t need special glasses - becomes both widespread and cheap. In the meantime, Brown thinks $1 glasses will be widely affordable to schools, museums, medical centers and businesses that are likely to use 3-D Cyber-Commons facilities.<br><br>

Using 2009 federal economic stimulus grants, EVL worked with Oregon-based Planar Systems to create a 3-D LCD, ultra-thin border flat-panel display wall that gives Cyber-Commons its new, added dimension. After working together on a display prototype, Planar provided EVL with customized technology which they call the &ldquo;Clarity Matrix LCD Video Wall&rdquo;. Planar - a company specializing in high quality visualization and digital signage displays - gets a new product to market.<br><br>

Leigh will test UIC&rsquo;s CC3D facility next spring when he collaboratively teaches a video game development course with a professor at Louisiana State University. He said UIC-EVL&rsquo;s focus is on scientific research and educational use, such as medicine, engineering and chemistry, where adding 3-D images which researchers, students and instructors can jointly manipulate and study offers real insight and understanding.<br><br>

&ldquo;3-D is more than Hollywood gimmickry,&rdquo; said Leigh. &ldquo;Humans understand information much more effectively in 3-D.&rdquo; Visualizing a molecule, for example, in only two-dimensions can be too abstract or lack the depth cues to be adequately comprehended. Geoscience is another field where 3-D adds substantial advantages. Leigh cited a study of male and female students that found females had typically performed poorer in geospatial tests. But when stereoscopic - 3-D - capability was added to the visualization, both males and females improved and the gender differences disappeared. &ldquo;It eliminates that barrier,&rdquo; Leigh said.<br><br>

CC3D will also serve as a technology test bed for UIC-EVL&rsquo;s &ldquo;Next-Generation CAVE&rdquo; Automatic Virtual Environment facility, debuting a year from now. CAVE, developed 20 years ago at EVL and now commercialized by companies around the world, originally used projectors and very expensive 3-D glasses to work. Leigh calls the new display technology for CC3D bright and &ldquo;gloriously beautiful.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be the first to build an LCD, non-projector-based CAVE,&rdquo; said Leigh. &ldquo;We calculate that the display resolution will be on the order of what matches human vision.&rdquo;<br><br>

UIC-EVL doctoral graduate Tom Peterka, now a scientist at Argonne National Laboratory, is helping in both NG-CAVE and CC3D development with an eye on possible use of such 3-D technology at America&rsquo;s national laboratories.
