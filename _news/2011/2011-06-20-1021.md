Jason Leigh, director of the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory and professor of Computer Science, was recently notified that he has been selected a University Scholar for 2011-2012.<br><br>

The University of Illinois created the University Scholars Program to honor and reward outstanding teachers and scholars. Awards are a symbol of the recipient&rsquo;s excellence and the University&rsquo;s commitment to foster outstanding people and their work. Leigh was nominated by his peers and selected from a pool of talented nominees. The honor includes a three-year stipend, to be spent in support of university-related teaching or research.<br><br>

This coming academic year, each University of Illinois campus will release an official announcement of the new University Scholars and will host a banquet to recognize this high distinction.<br><br>

CONGRATULATIONS, JASON!<br><br>
