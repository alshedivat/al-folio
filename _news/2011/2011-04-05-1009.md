EVL graduate research assistant, JD Pirtle joins fellow MFA candidates in 2011 Thesis Exhibitions, April 5-30, Gallery 400, University of Illinois at Chicago.<br><br>

Pirtle&rsquo;s thesis work <em>The Fall Beyond Tomorrow&rsquo;s Life</em> uses water as a novel interface for the creation of a unique soundscape; as a viewer disturbs the surface of the water, or bends over to look into the sculptural pool, sounds resonate throughout the environment.<br><br>
 
All aspects of this project incorporate the use of digital technologies - from design concept, pre-visualization, prototyping, modeling and execution. Pirtle functions equally as an artist, programmer, and creative technologist to focus on visualizations and sonifications that bridge the void between the conventional and technological.<br><br>

Exhibition: April 26-30<br>
Opening reception: April 29, 5-8PM<br><br>
