<strong>Are you interested in learning a cool 3D-touch technology?</strong><br><br>

EVL collaborator, Research Assistant Professor Cristian Luciano (MIE) introduces UIC&rsquo;s first hands-on course on haptics (or the sense of touch) and augmented reality. You&rsquo;ll learn how to successfully combine high-level 3D graphics, haptics, collision detection and physics-based dynamic simulation for a more realistic interactive experience. You&rsquo;ll be able to easily develop virtual reality applications to visualize and feel holographic-like virtual objects for engineering, medical, dental and scientific simulation and training.<br><br>

Multiple SensAble Technologies&rsquo; Omni haptic devices and PC workstations will be available for the students to develop the projects.<br><br>

<strong>Time:</strong> MW, 4:30 PM - 5:45 PM<br>
<strong>Place:</strong> 3290 SEL<br>
<strong>Pre-requisites:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Recommended for:</strong> Grads and undergrads<br><br>
