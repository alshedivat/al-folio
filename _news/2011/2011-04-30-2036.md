As a demonstration of cultural heritage, participants can view 360-degree panoramic images of Medinet Habu, the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III located on the West Bank of Luxor in Egypt, in the CAVE2&trade; System. The 360-degree photographic images were taken by Tom DeFanti of California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) at University of California, San Diego, on April 30, 2011, with the assistance of Adel Saad and Greg Wickham of King Abdullah University for Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, using the CAVEcam camera developed by Dick Ainsworth, Dan Sandin, and Tom DeFanti. Images were stitched together by Dick Ainsworth. Calit2&rsquo;s CalVR software is used to display the panoramic image in the CAVE2.
