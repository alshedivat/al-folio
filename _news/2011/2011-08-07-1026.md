The 38th annual ACM SIGGRAPH international conference and exhibition on computer graphics and interactive techniques is taking place in Vancouver, Canada, this week (August 7-11, 2011). The Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at University of Illinois at Chicago, working with Calit2 at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), is demonstrating visualization tools and technologies in the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology (KAUST) booth. Calit2 has a special partnership agreement with KAUST, with a subcontract to EVL, to pursue advanced visualization technologies.<br><br>

Calit2 developed portable 2x2 tiled display walls that fold up into their own shipping cases. Two of these portable optical-network-enabled walls, called &ldquo;OptIPortables,&rdquo; can be connected together to form a 2x4 tiled display wall. Now imagine eight OptIportables arranged in an outward-facing octagon shape (an &ldquo;OctIPortable&rdquo;), which is what UCSD built and shipped to SIGGRAPH, for display in the KAUST booth. One of the 2x4 walls was equipped with a touch screen in order to run EVL software, notably SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment) and other applications, such as EVL&rsquo;s Paint Program.<br><br>
 
Audience reaction to EVL&rsquo;s Paint program on Calit2&rsquo;s OptIPortable display has been phenomenal. On Wednesday, August 10, the print version of the Vancouver Sun newspaper, on the front page of its Business section, featured a photo of an attendee drawing on &ldquo;&hellip;an interactive display that has been transformed into a giant canvas by Chicago&rsquo;s King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.&rdquo; The online version of the article has 3 pictures (out of 10) of people drawing on the display, saying that &ldquo;convention-goers check out Nvidia&rsquo;s display booth.&rdquo;<br><br>

Sadly, KAUST is not in Chicago, and Nvidia, a highly respected visual computing company, was not involved in the creation of KAUST&rsquo;s booth at SIGGRAPH. However, my years of PR training have taught me that &ldquo;ink is ink&rdquo;. In PR, it&rsquo;s most important to get mentioned by the press, and then hope they mention your name, and ultimately hope they spell your name right. And, not only did we get mentioned, but our application was featured!!!<br><br>

I&rsquo;ll send out further updates from SIGGRAPH as I learn about them.<br>
