EVL&rsquo;s Nicholas Schwarz presented his thesis, <em>Distributed Volume Rendering of Very Large Data on High-Resolution Scalable Displays</em>, at EVL&rsquo;s main lab.<br><br>

This thesis presents a methodology for rendering very large volume data on scalable high-resolution displays using a distributed-memory cluster.<br><br>

The methodology uses a multi-resolution octree, an image-order data distribution method, a distributed shared-memory data management system, a multi-level cache, and hardware accelerated rendering techniques to produce a solution that is scalable in terms of input size and output resolution.<br><br>

An analytical cost model validated by experimental results predicts the system&rsquo;s behavior. The methodology&rsquo;s usefulness is demonstrated with a number of domain specific datasets.<br><br>

The primary contributions of this thesis include:<br>
<ol>
<li>A review of research in the field of volume rendering and parallel volume rendering.</li>
<li>A methodology for rendering very large volume data on scalable high-resolution displays using a commodity distributed-memory cluster of computers that scales with the size of input data and the output resolution.</li>
<li>An analytical model validated by experimental results that predicts the methodology&rsquo;s behavior.</li>
<li>The application of this methodology to domain specific problems in the fields of bioscience, geoscience and medicine.</li>
</ol>
