Room 1000, Science & Engineering Office Building, UIC<br><br>
UIC Computer Science and EVL exchange student from the Politecnico di Milano in Italy, Andrea Rottigni presents his thesis research that explores the use of Virtual Reality for upper-limb and walking rehabilitation.<br><br>
&ldquo;RehabJim&rdquo; is a serious game designed for post-stroke patients to help with upper-limb rehabilitation using the CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment. The application can be run in two modes - first and third person perspectives to allow domain scientists to better understand, which mode might be most effective in patient rehabilitation. A small user study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of each perspective mode.<br><br>
&ldquo;CAVEChef&rdquo;, another serious game developed for the CAVE2 to assist post-stroke patients in walking rehabilitation tasks.  &ldquo;CAVEChef&rdquo; uses a third person perspective.
