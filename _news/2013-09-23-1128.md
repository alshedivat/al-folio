In April 2013, the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) &ldquo;SpiderSense&rdquo; project - a prototype wearable suit that enables users to sense (without seeing) obstacles around them - was getting a great deal of publicity. SpiderSense was a project done for the <a href="http://www.humanaugmentics.org">UIC Human Augmentics course</a>, an interdisciplinary class aimed at the research and development of technologies for expanding the capabilities and characteristics of humans.<br><br>

<strong>SpiderSense</strong> caught the public&rsquo;s attention (and imagination) after Victor Mateevitsi, a PhD student in the UIC Computer Science Department and a Research Assistant at EVL, presented a paper at the 4th Augmented Human International Conference in Stuttgart, Germany, held in March 2013. The paper was co-authored by Brad Haggadone (UIC Communications), Jason Leigh and Robert Kenyon (UIC Computer Science, EVL), and Brian Kunzer (UIC Bioengineering, Neural Engineering Vision Laboratory).<br><br>

Mateevitsi continues to give presentations and give interviews to the press. Also, &ldquo;SpiderSense&rdquo; was a finalist in the <a href="http://grad.uic.edu/cms/?pid=1001233">UIC Image of Research 2013 competition</a>.<br><br>

A list of the most recent presentations and publications mentioning UIC and SpiderSense are listed here.<br><br>
