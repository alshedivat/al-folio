<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
From spreadsheets to database and Cloud services, data management software and systems use query based features for focused data inquiry and to examine results inquired from connected relationships among its components. Today&rsquo;s data-management systems are able to perform queries on SQL, NoSQL and semantic based structures for a scalable range of data. Partitioning techniques, network reduction algorithms, and memory based indexing schemes have been heavily researched and integrated into different data management products, in order to produce faster and scalable query results. However, there has been little to no research in using memory management and join pre-processing within a distributed environment to create scalable queries and to understand scale, based on query complexity.
