Logistics and security planning for the 2009 Presidential inauguration is being facilitated by EVL&rsquo;s OptIPortal display technology. In collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center, the OptIPortal was deployed at the Department of Interior&rsquo;s main office in Reston, Virginia. In addition to helping the U.S. Department of Homeland Security plan for the upcoming inauguration, it will also be used for future emergency response activities.<br><br>
