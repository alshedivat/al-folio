The depositar lab has been invited by the Research Data Alliance (RDA) to talk about our open science work in Taiwan. Besides our lab, Estelle Cheng, Manager APAC Engagement from ORCID will also share their experience during the event.

This webinar is part of RDA’s regional info sessions taking place in June and July. It is a great chance to learn about RDA and the upcoming International Data Week during October 13-16th in Brisbane, Australia.
