We are excited to share that the depositar lab has been invited by the Research Data Alliance (RDA) to talk about our open science work in Taiwan! Besides our lab, Estelle Cheng, Manager APAC Engagement at ORCID, will also share insights during the event.

This webinar is part of RDA’s regional info sessions running throughout June and July. It is a great opportunity to:
- Learn more about the Research Data Alliance and its global community
- Hear what’s coming up at International Data Week 2025 hosted jointly by the Committee on Data (CODATA) and the World Data System (WDS) of the International Science Council (ISC), and the Research Data Alliance (RDA). It will take place in Brisbane, Australia during October 13–16.
- Connect with others working on open science and data sharing
