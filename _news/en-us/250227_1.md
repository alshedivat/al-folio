On the last day of the first month of the Lunar New Year, we at the depositar lab wish you a joyful New Year. We take this occasion to summarize below our works from the previous year (2024-01 -- 2024-12).

### Hosted Projects and Datasets

+ There have been 2,661 datasets deposited and made public at the [depositar](https://data.depositar.io), the research data repository we build and operate, by the end of Year 2024 (2024-12-31). The number of public datasets now grows to 2,725 (2025-02-27). 

+ There are now 359 projects hosted at the depositar (2025-02-27).

### System Upgrade and Enhancement

+ The [system](https://github.com/depositar/ckanext-data-depositario/) underlining the depositar (data.depositar.io) had been upgraded six times (from [v6.6.3](https://docs.depositar.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v6-6-3-2024-01-04) to [v6.7.1](https://docs.depositar.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v6-7-1-2024-09-18)).

+ The CKAN package, which is the core of the depositar, has been updated to [version 2.10](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.10/changelog.html#v-2-10-0-2023-02-15) with email login, table view, Font Awesome 6.0 icons, and more.

### Writing on Research Data Management (RDM) 
+ Seven new articles appeared on the [RDM Hub](https://rdm.depositar.io/) website.

+ Of the above, five were cross-posted on the  _Science and Technology Monthly_ website (on [2024-01-15](https://www.scimonth.com.tw/archives/8763), [2024-03-15](https://www.scimonth.com.tw/archives/8841),[2024-05-15](https://www.scimonth.com.tw/archives/9916), [2024-09-30](https://www.scimonth.com.tw/archives/11104), and [2024-11-14](https://www.scimonth.com.tw/archives/11184)).
