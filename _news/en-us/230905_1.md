### Lecture Description
"As operators of research data repositories, what aspects should we consider to effectively assist researchers?" This is a question often pondered by depositar team members during the development and research process.

To ensure the reproducibility of academic research and to enhance the efficiency of scientific research, an increasing number of research funding agencies and journals now require researchers to state how and when their research data will be made accessible (by depositing it in publicly accessible research data repositories, for example). Additionally, research teams are required to have "Data Management Plans" (DMP) when they begin their research projects. The DMP shall detail the methods for collecting, recording, managing, and preserving data during the research projects, as well as how ongoing management of research data will be carried out.

This lecture will start from the perspective of research data repository operators and explain how research data repositories can assist researchers in data management. It will cover fundamental concepts of research data management, the formulation of data management plans, and developments in international policies related to open science.
