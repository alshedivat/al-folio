The depositar team was invited to participate in the [CKAN Live online meetup](https://ckan.org/events/depositar-public-research-data-repository-built-on-ckan) in November 2024 and gave a presentation titled *Depositar â€“ A Public Research Data Repository Built on CKAN*, sharing our experiences over the past few years in building a research data repository on the CKAN platform. We also engaged in discussions with CKAN community partners and the technical team. Approximately 50 people attended the event.

The slideset is at the depositar [ark:37281/k5r1c1v47](https://pid.depositar.io/ark:37281/k5r1c1v47), and the event recording will be edited and later released on the [CKAN Association YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ckanassociation6525).
