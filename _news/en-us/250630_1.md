The depositar team were glad to attend the 20th International Conference on Open Repositories earlier this month at the University of Chicago. Li Fan Wang presented "Automated Data Analytics: A Statistical Dashboard Built with GitLab CI/CD for a Data Repository Based on CKAN" at Developer Track Session 2 on June 17. The presentation slideset can be found at the depositar ([ark:37281/k5w9w7145](https://pid.depositar.io/ark:37281/k5w9w7145)).

The following is the abstract of the presentation. 

_Recently Orphaned Newspapers: From Archived Webpages to Reusable Datasets and Research Outlooks_

Li Fan Wang, Cheng-Jen Lee, and Tyng-Ruey Chuang

> This project presents a fully automated, cost effective, and highly available statistical dashboard providing an overview of the current status of the CKAN-based data repository depositar. The dashboard is built entirely with open-source tools and is automatically refreshed daily with the help of GitLabâ€™s CI/CD pipelines. This practice demonstrates how to automate data analytics and visualization without incurring heavy costs, offering an innovative approach to collecting status data and sharing repository insights.
