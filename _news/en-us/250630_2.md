By giving these short courses, we hope to introduce the students to the basics of research data management and static website generation, as well as to the use and enrichment of communal resources of geographic information and structured data. The courses will be held at the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, and conducted in Taiwanese Mandarin. After taking these courses, the interns will work on individual projects. 

We are very grateful to our guest lecturers: Dennis Raylin Chen (Wikimedia Taiwan), Ming-Syuan Ho (National Institute of Cyber Security), Hsiung-Ming Liao (GIS Center, RCHSS, Academia Sinica), and Yu-Huang Wang (Nature Watch Ecological and Environmental Consultancy).

This year the summer internship students are from the National Cheng Kung University, the National Chung Cheng University, the National Sun Yat-sen University, the National Taiwan University, and the National Yunlin University of Science and Technology in Taiwan, and from the University of California San Diego in the US.
