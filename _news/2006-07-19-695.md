Chicago - A memorandum of understanding between the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Japan&rsquo;s National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) will be signed to formalize a collaboration that puts Chicago at the hub of ultra-high-speed advanced optical network research and development exchanges with Japanese research and education institutions.<br><br>

The Japanese Advanced Testbed Network for Research and Development, known as JGN-II, links Tokyo with Chicago via StarLight, a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded advanced Internet switching facility located at Northwestern University&rsquo;s downtown Chicago campus and managed by UIC and Northwestern.<br><br>

Japan&rsquo;s choice of Chicago&rsquo;s StarLight underscores confidence in both the technology and research being conducted at UIC to develop new application tools and techniques that enable, for example, real-time transmission of super-high-resolution images (four times the quality of current HDTV) and computer simulations over long-distance optical networks.<br><br>

Researchers from UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), will be available to describe likely applications for this technology.<br><br>

The signing will take place Wednesday, July 26, in UIC&rsquo;s University Hall.
