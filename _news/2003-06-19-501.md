EVL&rsquo;s PARIS system demonstrated the possibilities for clinical rehabilitation of the human sensory-motor system at the 26th International RESNA Conference. Participants interacted with virtual objects using stereo vision and a haptic robot.  The event highlighted the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) launch into the public arena only after six months of operation.<br><br>

RERC is chartered with developing an augmented reality (AR) system interfaced with a robot for training and rehabilitation purposes.
