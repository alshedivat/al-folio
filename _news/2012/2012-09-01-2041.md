On-line, real-time audio dilation is a technique that time stretches, or slows down the tempo of audio signals as they are generated. This research focuses upon the control over incoming live audio tempo for increased intelligibility and comfort.<br><br>

The system features networked, full duplex communication, independent variable dilation rates, variable voice activation detection and a length (visual) audio storage buffer.  Anticipated application areas include public safety, pilot / flight controllers, language translation, international communication, hearing loss, to name a few.
