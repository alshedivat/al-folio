Participants stand inside virtual train tracks in the CAVE2&trade; System to observe distortion as high-speed trains roar past. This visualization of fundamental dynamics phenomena related to high-speed rail operations was done in collaboration with the National University Rail (NURail) Center - which consists of researchers at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Michigan Tech University, University of Kentucky, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology - and is funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Understanding track structure movements, liquid sloshing, and wheel / rail contact locations are among several transportation research areas that require sophisticated virtual-reality tools such as the CAVE2 System. Visualization by the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL). EVL&rsquo;s OmegaLib software is used to display the 3D model in the CAVE2.<br><br>
