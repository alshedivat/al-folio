In this application, participants view several 2-dimensional high-resolution images captured by the Mars Curiosity Rover in EVL&rsquo;s CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment.  Using EVL&rsquo;s SAGE&trade; (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment) middleware a broad range of digital media, including 2D images, files and documents, as well stereo imagery, 3D models, can be displayed for contrast, comparison and discussion. The 2D data displayed in this application is from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and California Institute of Technology.
