On Monday, October 8, 2012, the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) participated in <a href="http://www.chicagoideas.com">Chicago Ideas Week</a>, whose goal is &ldquo;the sharing of ideas, inspiring action, and igniting change to positively impact our world.&rdquo; Chicago Ideas Week organized behind-the-scene tours of local research facilities to enable &ldquo;participants to experience and explore the best of Chicago,&rdquo; and the EVL tour quickly sold out early.<br><br>
 
The audience consisted of Chicagoland entrepreneurs, academics, students, museum staffers and students, as well as Channel 7 News. EVL is one of several sites to appear in the Channel 7 news broadcast that aired last night - showcasing CAVE2&trade;, the next-generation virtual-realiity environment that EVL is premiering this week, as well as a brief interview with EVL director Jason Leigh. <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8839408">Watch the broadcast</a>.
