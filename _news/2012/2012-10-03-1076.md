EVL alumni Vikas Chowdhry, and Epic colleague, Tom Yosick present at EVL tech meeting.<br><br>

<em>Clinical Intelligence</em> is a rapidly growing and evolving field that uses data to improve healthcare outcomes. In this presentation, Vikas and Tom share specific examples in which analytical and quantitative methods were used to accomplish objectives as diverse as predictive modeling for patient mortality, measuring differences in the quality of healthcare across regions, and assessing the effectiveness of process improvements in clinical workflows. They will also discuss the future of healthcare analytics and how both providers and Epic are leveraging the fields of big data, predictive modeling, and expert systems to improve healthcare.
