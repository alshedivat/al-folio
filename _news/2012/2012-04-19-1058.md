Tom Marrinan, a student of UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), in collaboration with student Ian Gould of the UIC Bioengineering Laboratory for Product and Process Design, received 1st Place in campus&rsquo; 2012 Image of Research competition. Winning entries from this annual interdisciplinary event showcase the breadth and diversity of research at UIC.<br><br>

Winning entries are on exhibit in the lobby of the Daley Library from April 19 - May 31, in the Library of Health Sciences, and featured on light pole banners around campus. Winners, finalists and a wide selection of other entries are also posted to an <a href="http://grad.uic.edu/cms/?pid=1000645">online gallery in the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois (CARLI)</a>.<br><br>

Marrinan and Gould&rsquo;s image is the result of collaboration between a computer science student specializing in scientific visualization and a bioengineering student with research interests in cerebral blood flow, and depicts the complex architecture of the cerebral vascular network.<br><br>
