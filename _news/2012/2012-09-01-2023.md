Participants can explore the self-assembly of a ligated gold nanoparticle and proteins inside an ionic solution in the CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment. Data and visualization provided by the Petr Kral Research Group at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and the Vincent M. Rotello Research Group at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. OmegaLib software by the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) is used to display the 3D model in the CAVE2.<br><br>
