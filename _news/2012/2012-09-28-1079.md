EVL alumnus Julio Obelleiro exhibits his projects <strong>Super Hero</strong> and <strong>Folded Light</strong> at the Dumbo Arts Festival, spanning the neighborhood of DUMBO, Brooklyn, between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges, including the waterfront.<br><br>

<strong>Super Hero</strong> is an interactive projection mapping experience, in which participants are transformed into superheroes. Viewers are able to fly over the historic fa&ccedil;ade of Empire Stores, while enjoying a number of super powers, which they can control with natural gestures. These powers included throwing light balls, becoming gigantic or tiny, and, of course, flying. <strong><a href="http://www.julioobelleiro.com/folded-light/">Folded Light</a></strong> is a video installation where rotating video projection of light augments the physical space.<br><br>

Friday September 28th - Sunday September 30th<br>
Sundown to midnight for all outdoor projections.
Folded Light
