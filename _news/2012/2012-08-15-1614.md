This OpenGL graphics engine is my first graphics engine. It can be used to view complex geometric models as well as simple primitives. The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with OpenGL since in the past I have always used tools that hide the underlying OpenGL code. The graphics engine has a number of features such as Wavefront object file support, Phong shading model, basic shadows, interlaced 3D support, 2D UI support, built in camera controls, as well as a simple API to create custom scenes. This paper will describe the functionality of the graphics engine as well as the tools used and development process.
