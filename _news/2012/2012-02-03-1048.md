EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: The UIC NEWS article &ldquo;Learning in 3-D,&rdquo; published November 16, 2011, announced the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory&rsquo;s (EVL) new 3D version of its popular Cyber-Commons&rsquo; technology-enhanced classroom and meeting room.<br><br>

The article explained that the technology used to build the Cyber-Commons 3D tiled display wall - 3D ultra-thin border, flat-panel displays - was developed by EVL in partnership with Planar Systems, an Oregon-based company. EVL received funding to work on this from a U.S. National Science Foundation economic stimulus grant. This collaboration proved mutually beneficial, as EVL got customized technology that surpassed what was commercially available, and Planar got a new product to market.<br><br>

This week, Planar introduced its new 3D display product - named the Clarity&trade; Matrix 3D LCD video wall - at the Integrated Systems Europe (ISE) conference, held in Amsterdam January 31 - February 2, 2012.<br><br>

The Planar press release contains a quote from EVL director and UIC computer science professor Jason Leigh: &ldquo;The Clarity Matrix 3D LCD Video Wall System is changing the way we learn and communicate ideas,&rdquo; said Leigh. &ldquo;All students and faculty need to do is attach a laptop [to Cyber-Commons 3D] and put on a pair of inexpensive glasses to gain a whole new perspective on the subject matter they&rsquo;re studying. Sharing and collaborative analysis of images has never been simpler or more enlightening.&rdquo;<br><br>

In addition to the release, Planar has splashed photos of EVL&rsquo;s Cyber-Commons 3D on its home page and profiled EVL in a case study that provides a more in-depth review of how powerful 3D visualization is used in higher education. Leigh is quoted extensively. &ldquo;The Clarity Matrix 3D video wall is a powerful tool with which to communicate ideas,&rdquo; says Leigh. &ldquo;It lets people work together, make sense of lots of information, and derive insights quicker.&rdquo; Enterprises interested in 3D video wall technology include architectural firms, energy exploration companies, pharmaceutical firms, film and video game producers. &ldquo;They view our video wall as the standard of leading-edge technology that will improve their ability to visualize their own designs, data sets and models.&rdquo;<br><br>

EVL&rsquo;s work with Planar is an example of technology transfer at its best, as it has been a true partnership between academia and industry, resulting in new commercially available display technologies. Says Leigh is the case study: &ldquo;Planar&hellip; is unique in that they will custom-build a display wall that meets your interests. And they&rsquo;ll work with you doing it; sharing knowledge and solving problems in partnership. No other company has worked with us in this manner, and as a result, the experience has been more positive than we could have imagined.&rdquo;<br><br>

EVL continues to work with Planar on the development of its Next-Generation CAVE virtual reality theater, to debut this Fall. The two groups continue to work on prototypes of potentially future products.<br><br>
