Participants fly through a close-up of a glass fissure computed in a 5-Million atom molecular dynamics nanoscale simulation. Visualization by Aaron Knoll and Michael Papka of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) at Argonne National Laboratory and Khairi Reda of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Simulation and data provided by Kenichi Nomura and Priya Vashishta of University of Southern California. EVL&rsquo;s OmegaLib software is used to display the 3D model in the CAVE2&trade; System.<br><br>
