To show medical illustrators and educators the value of virtual reality for medical training, the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago mocked up a 3D skeleton, complete with body organs, including the heart, lungs, and intestines, that students could manipulate on the walls of the CAVE2&trade; System. Datasets used are publicly available on the web. An EVL student lies on a bench in front of the walls for added effect. EVL&rsquo;s OmegaLib software is used to display the 3D model in the CAVE2 System.
