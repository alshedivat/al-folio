Copper Giloth is Associate Professor of Art at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Director of Academic Computing in the Office of Information Technologies (OIT). Her projects take the form of drawings, books, animations, videos, websites and installations. Her work has been exhibited in the U.S., Japan, Canada, and across Europe. Her recent sculpture, &ldquo;Hidden Family,&rdquo; was in a group exhibition in New Haven, CT in Spring 2011. Several of her works in the &ldquo;Alphabet of Computer Graphics&rdquo; series and &ldquo;Mother-Daughter BIOGRIDS&rdquo; are in a group exhibition in New Haven, CT in 2011-12. Her series of prints &ldquo;The Practice of Daily Life&rdquo; (&ldquo;La Pratique du Quotidien&rdquo;) based on photographs and observations while living for a year in Aix-en-Provence France was exhibited at SIGGRAPH 2007 in Los Angeles and in a one-person exhibition at Herter Gallery, Amherst, MA. Much of her earliest work was among the pioneering efforts in the then nascent field of computer art and computer graphics. She organized the first two international ACM SIGGRAPH Art Show Competitions in 1982 and 1983. The 1983 exhibition traveled to 30 locations in the U.S., Canada, France, and Japan. Her website documenting the SIGGRAPH &rsquo;82 Art Exhibition is located at: <a href="http://people.umass.edu/sig82art/">people.umass.edu/sig82art/</a>.
