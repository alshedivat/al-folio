EVL collaborator, professor Stellan Ohlsson (Department of Psychology, UIC) attended <a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/conferences/persuasive2012/">Persuasive 2012: The 7th International Conference on Persuasive Technology</a>.<br><br>

Similar to EVL&rsquo;s Human Augmentics research, Persuasive Technology is a stimulating interdisciplinary research field that focuses on how interactive technologies and services can be designed to influence people&rsquo;s attitudes and support positive behavior change. The 2012 conference featured the latest insights into how mobile and internet-based applications such as mobile games and social networking sites could be designed to support positive behaviors changes in areas such as health, safety, and education.<br><br>

Professor Ohlsson gives an overview of what he learned and his impressions of the conference at EVL&rsquo;s tech meeting 8/1/12.
