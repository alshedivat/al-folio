EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: We love bragging about EVL alumni, if they let us know what they are doing. The February 3, 2012 edition of Science magazine not only  announced the winners of the annual Science / NSF International Science &amp; Engineering Visualization Challenge, but displayed one of the winners on the cover of their journal. One of those winners - EVL&rsquo;s own, Julieta Aguilera!<br><br>

<strong>Julieta Aguilera, UIC / EVL MFA 2006</strong> and now Adler Planetarium&rsquo;s Associate Director of the Space Visualization Laboratory for Interactive and Immersive Visualization, contributed to the cover of &ldquo;Science,&rdquo; the world&rsquo;s leading journal of original scientific research, global news, and commentary. Aguilera and her colleagues at Adler, along with partners at Johns Hopkins University, were awarded first place in the informational graphics category in the 2011 Science / NSF International Science &amp; Engineering Visualization Challenge. This annual Challenge, sponsored by Science magazine and the U.S. National Science Foundation(NSF), promotes cutting-edge efforts to visualize scientific data, principles, and ideas - skills critical for communication among scientists and between scientists and the general public. The image depicts the network of voids in the cosmic web, where each void can be tens of millions of light-years across. <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6068/530.full">MORE INFORMATION</a>
