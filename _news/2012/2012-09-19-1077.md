EVL alumna Julieta Aguilera and UIC New Media Arts associate professor Daria Tsoupikova present <em>Media Arts in Support of Science Education</em> at the International Symposium on Electronic Art (ISEA) 2012 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, September 19-24, 2012. ISEA, explores the discourse of global proportions on the subject of art, technology and nature.<br><br>

Four UIC Electronic Visualization MFA alumnae and a New Media Arts faculty present research projects produced by the Adler Planetarium, Chicago, IL; NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, MD; The Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, IL; and UIC.  Presentations exemplify how artists cross disciplinary borders to collaborate on the development of innovative educational learning applications. Special emphasis is placed on the role of media arts in the development of interactive learning environments for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).<br><br>
