Several weeks ago information about an excellent article profiling EVL&rsquo;s Daria Tsoupikova, associate professor in the UIC School of Art and Design, who is part of a team developing virtual-reality-based therapies for stroke patient rehabilitation.<br><br>

This week, the National Stroke Association posted both the article and an accompanying videotape of Tsoupikova&rsquo;s work with the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (RIC) on its <a href="http://www.facebook.com/NationalStrokeAssociation">Facebook page</a>. One person commented, &ldquo;My care team has encouraged my online video game habit; calling it therapeutic.&rdquo;<br><br>

In addition, the RIC Machines Assisting Recovery from Stroke - Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (MARS-RERC) posted the article and video on its website.<br><br>

<a href="http://www.ric.org/research/centers/mars2/mars2.aspx">Article in NEWS IN 2012</a><br>
<a href="http://www.ric.org/research/centers/mars2/d2vid.aspx">MARS-RERC Video</a><br><br>

This project is now starting clinical trials, so more exciting developments are on the horizon.
