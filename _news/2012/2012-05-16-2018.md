<strong>omegalib</strong> is middleware designed to ease the development of applications for virtual reality (VR) and immersive display environments. A C++ and Python API. Applications can be developed as standalone executables in C++ or as scripts in Python. omegalib also supports mixed native / script applications with user-defined C++ modules that can be exposed to Python through a simple declarative interface. omelib&rsquo;s main features are:<br>
<ul>
<li>Support for hybrid systems, presenting high definition 2D and 3D content on the same display</li>
<li>Display system scalability: omegalib runs on desktop machines, multi-GPU workstations driving tiled displays, and cluster systems like the 36-machine, 72-display CAVE2</li>
<li>Runtime application switching: applications can be reloaded or swapped without restarting the display system</li>
<li>Web interface control and pixel streaming to HTML5 clients</li>
<li>Experimental SAGE integration</li>
<li>A customizable 2D / 3D widgets library</li>
<li>Support for a wide range of input peripherals (controllers, motion capture systems, touch surfaces)</li>
<li>Integration with third party higher level toolkits like Unity, VTK, Open Scene Graph, Qt, etc.</li>
</ul><br>

Although omegalib is designed mostly to run on VR systems, it can be used to develop applications on standard desktop systems as well, leveraging the power of multiple GPUs when available.
