## MARS3 - Machines Assisting Recovery from Stroke

Stroke is the fifth most common cause of mortality in the United States as reported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.  Medical treatment and physical therapy are imperative for the management of stroke, the reduction in risks of recurrent strokes and recovery of lost motor controls.  The success of a medical treatment is determined largely by adherence to therapy.  However, research has shown that adherence to therapy in patients who have had a stroke is often suboptimal.  This project focuses on the end goal of being able to test adherence, aims at creating and setting up an immersive 3D environment with an interactive game through the use of modern motion detection sensors.
