The September 2, 2012 issue of UIC NEWS profiles Computer Science MS student Jillian Aurisano. She&rsquo;s a woman who is working in a field where women are a minority.<br><br>

Statistics are depressing. The Computing Research Association&rsquo;s Taulbee Survey for 2010-11 states that less than 12% of Computer Science degrees were awarded to women, as documented in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing">Wikipedia</a>.<br><br>

In this UIC NEWS profile, Aurisano compares computer literacy to writing. &ldquo;We believe all children should learn to write so they can express themselves. I believe CS is a similar form of expression,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In some sense, the issue is not just about the lack of women [in the field], it&rsquo;s that a narrow segment of people are learning to express themselves using computing.&rdquo;<br><br>

Aurisano is a research assistant in the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), where she combines her undergraduate work in biology with her Master&rsquo;s degree work in computer science. In the UIC NEWS article, she explains, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working with a series of computer monitors connected together, driven by a single computer&hellip; I hope to write programs to take biological data, questions researchers have, and translate it to interactive visual representation to permit researchers to take advantage of large high-resolution digital space. Huge wall screens can show lots of data, lots of juxtaposed information, considering lots of pieces of the puzzle,&rdquo; she said, and expects them to be standard equipment in labs and offices within 10 to 20 years.<br><br>
