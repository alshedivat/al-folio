Steve Jones, UIC Communications professor, is a long-time EVL collaborator. His new book, <strong><em>Afterlife as Afterimage</em></strong>, based on his interest in posthumous fame, seems a natural since he&rsquo;s been involved with EVL&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/lifelike/index.php">LifeLike project</a> - to create realistic-looking avatars of known individuals - since its inception. Jones is profiled in the April 18th issue of <a href="http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/uicnews/articledetail.cgi?id=16293">UIC NEWS, Profile: Steve Jones is a virtual communications expert</a>. UIC News is the newspaper for the faculty, staff and students of the University of Illinois at Chicago.
&ldquo;Technology is sort of the new pop culture,&rdquo; says communication professor Steve Jones, who&rsquo;s widely quoted in the national media.
