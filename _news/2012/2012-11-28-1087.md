EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: Here are excerpts from a recent article by Northwestern University journalism student Mitch Smith on standing on the bridge of the StarTrek Enterprise in EVL&rsquo;s new CAVE2&trade; hybrid-reality environment.<br><br>

<strong>Move over, Holodeck</strong><br>
by Mitch Smith, Medill Reports Chicago<br>
Nov 28, 2012<br><br>

For the last two years, much of his - UIC computer science graduate student and EVL research assistant Arthur Nishimoto&rsquo;s - free time went into designing the guts of Star Trek&rsquo;s starship Enterprise, from the bridge to the transporter room. His design might offer a preview of the future of video games.<br><br>

At first, the Enterprise lived only in the two-dimensional world of a computer screen. But in recent months, Nishimoto has been able to walk around the command center of the ship that figured prominently in the Star Trek movies and television series.<br><br>

That extra dimension took shape thanks to CAVE2, a three-dimensional virtual reality system unveiled earlier this year at UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory.<br><br>

Nishimoto studied Star Trek videos and set designs to make his model precise. Eventually, he&rsquo;d like to see his Enterprise design emerge as a video game.<br><br>

Virtual interactive experiences where players maneuver their way through an environment are part of video gaming&rsquo;s future, UIC researchers say.<br><br>

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting the 3D, we&rsquo;ve got hi-res,&rdquo; said UIC computer scientist Andrew Johnson, a creator of CAVE2. But when it comes to video games, &ldquo;we still don&rsquo;t have that enveloping experience of things being around you. It&rsquo;s a really different experience when you&rsquo;re moving naturally. Physical skill actually becomes important again.&rdquo;<br><br>

That new paradigm poses challenges for video game designers, he said.<br><br>

&ldquo;You want to make it look like a Hollywood film model but feel like a video game model,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a really delicate balance you have to do to keep interactivity and realism.&rdquo;<br><br>
