Participants in the CAVE2&trade; System stand inside a balls-and-sticks model of a molecular chemistry dataset. The clouds represent the density of electrons around atoms.  Chemistry models and simulation data are provided by Aslihan Sumer, Juliuis Jellineck and Michael Papka of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) at Argonne National Laboratory. Visualization was created by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. EVL&rsquo;s OmegaLib software is used to display the 3D model in the CAVE2.<br><br>
