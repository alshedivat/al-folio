The article <em>Medicine&rsquo;s Next Frontier</em> by Sandra Guy appeared in the June 26, 2010 issue of the Chicago Sun-Times. It reports on a major new grant from the National Science Foundation to the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) to build the Next-Generation CAVE (NG-CAVE). The first generation CAVE (CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment), also developed by EVL and introduced in 1992, was a room-sized virtual-reality theater where images were rear-projected onto 3 walls and downward projected onto the floor.<br><br>

The new design will take advantage of today&rsquo;s full-high-definition flat panels, making the NG-CAVE significantly cheaper, brighter, and easier to maintain than the original CAVE. The NG-CAVE will deliver better color, more graphics and text, and achieve a human&rsquo;s 20/20 vision quality. It will be configurable as either a 3-D display (requiring lightweight stereo glasses) or a 2-D wall, and will be used both locally by small or large groups and remotely by groups around the world to simultaneously share high-resolution images while collaborating with one another.<br><br>

EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: The above article is based on the article <em><a href="http://tigger.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/newsbureau/cgi-bin/index.cgi?from=Releases&amp;to=Release&amp;id=2899&amp;fromhome=1">Fantastic Journey to UIC&rsquo;s New CAVE</a></em> by Paul Francuch that appeared in the May 18, 2010 issue of UIC NEWS. The article&rsquo;s reference to medicine is based on <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=4&amp;indi=670">ongoing trials</a> that EVL is doing with the Division of Minimally Invasive, General &amp; Robotic Surgery in the Surgery Department of the UIC College of Medicine.
