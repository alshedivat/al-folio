<strong>ArtsReach Lecture on Web Art</strong><br>
Given the relative youth of the World Wide Web (WWW) compared to traditional art media, a surprising amount of development and growth has taken place in the last decade. Since the rise and fall of the dot com boom in the late 90&rsquo;s, artists have been given a new opportunity to assess the WWW as a tool for creating, developing, exchanging and exhibiting artwork. In this lecture, I will explain the narrative arc of the WWW as an artist&rsquo;s medium. We will start with how the web affected pre-existing art forms and continue to what new forms of art have been created since and where those new vectors may take us. We will examine this confluence of commerce and culture with examples and critical theory.
