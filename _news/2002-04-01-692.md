Andrew Johnson gave a presentation on STARTAP and a demonstration of the GeoWall at the first AMPATH International conference held in Valdivia, Chile.<br><br>

Building on last year&rsquo;s success with the Workshop to identify areas of Scientific Collaboration between the US and the AMPATH Service Area, the First AMPATH International Conference seeks to further delve into the benefits of utilizing the AMPATH advanced networking infrastructure for scientific research and education.<br><br>

Sponsored through a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the main objective of the conference is to create an environment for AMPATH participants, potential participants and those with a regional, hemispheric or international interest in the project to exchange ideas, form new and solidify existing collaborations.<br><br>

The conference will continue the work of identifying the universities and research centers in the AMPATH service area who require, or would take advantage of, high-performance connectivity to research institutions in the US and worldwide if it were available. Proposed speakers at the conference include researchers that participate in collaboratory projects between the U.S., Canada, the AMPATH service area, Europe and Asia / Pacific.<br><br>

The conference is being held in conjunction with REUNA&rsquo;s 2nd Congress on Science, Culture and Education over Internet2.
