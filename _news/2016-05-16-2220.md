The collaborative 3D virtual reality experience &ldquo;Hearts and Minds: The Interrogations Project&rdquo; was exhibited during 22nd International Symposium on Electronic Art (ISEA2016) at the Jeffrey Shaw 360 degree theater in Hong Kong.<br><br>
&ldquo;Hearts and Minds&rdquo; is a 3D narrative experience that gives voice to stories of violence and the post-traumatic stress experienced by ordinary American soldiers who became torturers in the course of serving their country.
The project was developed by a team including filmmaker Roderick Coover, writer Scott Rettberg, artist and visualization researcher Daria Tsoupikova, computer scientist Arthur Nishimoto, sound designer Mark Partridge, production assistant Mark Baratta, and senior research programmer Lance Long. Dr. Jeffrey Stevenson Murer of St. Andrews University, Scotland also contributed as a consultant on the project. EVL, the UIC Department of Art and Design, Temple University, and the Norwegian Research Council supported the development of the project.
