Though not officially yet launched, the CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment at Monash University is already a centerpiece of the new building that houses Monash&rsquo;s e-Research Centre and is receiving considerable interest from faculty, staff and students. The CAVE2 was developed by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago and licensed to Mechdyne Corporation, a U.S. company and one of the world&rsquo;s leading providers of innovative visual information technologies. Mechdyne and EVL worked with Monash to install the system. EVL has been involved with the e-Research Centre for many years on other projects, and now that Monash has a CAVE2 system - the second CAVE2 in the world, with the first being at EVL - the two groups are talking about ways to collaborate on research in the future.<br><br>

The primary Melbourne newspaper, The Age, recently did a story on Monash&rsquo;s CAVE2 system. Paul Bonnington, e-Research Centre director, and David Barnes, e-Research Centre senior research fellow, are interviewed in both the article and an accompanying video. While the video currently features applications developed by EVL and by UCSD and their collaborators, the e-Research Centre has already identified several campus research groups who want to visualize their data in 3D in the CAVE2 system.<br><br>

The article was published in the Monash paper, and reprinted in the Sydney and Brisbane newspapers. View the news coverage:<br><br>
