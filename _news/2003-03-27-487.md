<strong>Panel:</strong><br>
March 27th<br>
12:00 - 1:00pm<br><br>

<a href="http://www.nomadsandhomesteaders.org">Nomads &amp; Homesteaders</a> presents a panel - &ldquo;OpenSource Life&rdquo; as part of the Museum of Contemporary Art&rsquo;s Version>03 exhibition. To generate and cultivate new ideas and solutions addressing concerns about technology and its relationship to the environment, agriculture, and culture, the discussion will center around the concept of sustainability and the role community plays, or should play, in the implementation of agricultural technologies and simulation models. It will also examine how movements such as farming co-ops, organic seed trading collectives, and self-contained agricultural environments model certain logic structures and community tactics - which in turn resemble such diverse influences as open-source programming, activists and community organizing - in order to preserve biodiversity and help promote sustainability.<br><br>

Roy Plotnick (University of Illinois at Chicago), Nadine Bopp (Chicago Green Map Project), Dana Moser (Massachusetts College of Art), Claire Pentecost (School of the Art Institute of Chicago), and Greg Bor dowitz (School of the Art Institute of Chicago) acting as moderator.<br><br>
