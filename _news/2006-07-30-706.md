Daria Tsoupikova&rsquo;s research poster entitled <em>Cryptography and Mathematics</em> was presented at <em><a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2006/">SIGGRAPH 2006</a></em> on July 30-August 04, 2006, in Boston, MA. The Research Posters program presented the newest developing research in computer graphics and interactive techniques. It is a lively program for discussion and exchange of ideas, study latest research results in the computer graphic filed. The Research Posters program provided two forms of presentation: the display throughout the conference week and scheduled sessions of informal interaction and discussion. This allowed attendees to receive explanations in person and allowed presenter to receive feedback, ideas, and discuss the research results.<br><br>

The poster research work is an ongoing collaborative project between Daria Tsoupikova, EVL and Vera Pless, Department of Mathematics and Janet Beissinger from the Institute for Math and Science Education at UIC.<br><br>

The goal of the research project is to use multimedia to develop middle-grade mathematics materials that teach cryptography, the science of sending secret messages. The project is sponsored in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and includes the <em><a href="http://cryptoclub.math.uic.edu/indexmain.html">Cryptoclub</a></em> web site - which is the online community for children, students, and teachers interested in the area of Cryptography, the interactive game Treasure Hunt, and a book for students of grades 5-8 entitled <em>Cryptoclub - Using Mathematics to Make and Break Secret Codes</em> published in 2006 by AK Peters Inc.
