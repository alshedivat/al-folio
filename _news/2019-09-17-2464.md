Abstract:<br> 
Analysis of large, complex datasets stands to benefit from environments that permit users to view and juxtapose many views of data.  Large, high-resolution environments are capable of showing many related views of data, but interaction with these views poses significant challenges in visual and interaction design.  In this talk, I will present work toward &ldquo;multi-view interactions&rdqo; that enable users to create, organize and act on many views at once, through multi-modal speech+gesture queries in large flexible canvas environments.  The goal is the enable users to rapidly and efficiently generate sets of views in support of multi-view analysis tasks, organize these views to reflect changing analysis goals, and operate on sets of views collectively, rather than individually, to efficiently reach large portions of the &lsquo;data+attribute space&rsquo;.  I will implement and evaluate this approach within two domains and two user communities: City of Chicago data for informed citizens and deep learning predictions data for precision medicine in cancer.
