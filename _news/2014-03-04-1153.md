The article &ldquo;The CAVE artists&rdquo; was recently published in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v20/n3/full/nm0314-228.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureMedicine">Nature Medicine, Vol. 20, 2014, pp. 228-230, doi:10.1038/nm0314-228.</a> The article was published online March 4, 2014.<br><br>

<strong>SUMMARY</strong> In the era of big data, biomedical databases are brimming with protein structures, image collections and genomic sequences. As the data mount, new &ldquo;cave automatic virtual environments&rdquo;, or CAVEs, are being built to help researchers pick through the files. Dyani Lewis meets the pioneers behind these large-scale visualization labs to see whether immersive virtual worlds can cut through the complexity.<br><br>

The article notes that these large-scale visualization facilities are not widely used in the biomedical world. It cites the CAVE2&rsquo;s multimillion-dollar price tag. But, then gives several success stories of &ldquo;CAVE dwellers&rdquo; who have had &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moments viewing patterns in CAVE devices that were not previously apparent.<br><br>

One of the researchers featured in the article is Olusola Ajilore, a neuropsychiatrist at UIC. Ajilore is using the CAVE2 in Chicago to study whether impairments in white matter integrity underlie depression in the elderly. According to the article, &ldquo;Scientists like Ajilore are only too happy to be leading the charge. &lsquo;I think there&rsquo;s a huge upside in having new ways of visualizing large data sets,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;If we have innovative ways of being able to visualize that data and understand that data, hopefully that will lead to better discoveries.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br><br>

The article also has a table of notable CAVE&trade;s, CAVE2&trade;s and similar displays.
