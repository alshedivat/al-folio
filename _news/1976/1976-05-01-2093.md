In 1976, visiting artist and technologist Larry Cuba used the GRASS (Graphics Symbiosis System) language developed by EVL director Tom DeFanti during a residency at the University of Illinois at Chicago's Circle Graphics Habitat to create the animated Death Star trench run for the first &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; film release.<br><br>
A model of the Death Star was digitized, animated, and displayed using the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-11 Vector General series of minicomputers.  The vector graphics incorporated into the movie&rsquo:s war room scene were rescanned to film from the terminal face.  This is among some of the early special effects work attributed to EVL technology.
