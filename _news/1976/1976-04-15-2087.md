EVL directors Tom DeFanti and Dan Sandin initiated a series of real-time, interactive happenings or events that combined live computer graphics, image processing and sound synthesis, bringing together artists, technologist and computer graphics pioneers in Chicago to create what was termed the &rsquo;Electronic Visualization Events&rsquo; (EVE Events).  Held in what was called at the time the University of Illinois Circle Campus rotunda of the Science and Engineering South Building, these event occurred annually and inspired creative collaboration between scientists and artists, which has long been the underpinnings of EVL's philosophy and focus.<br><br>
EVE II was held in April of 1976.
