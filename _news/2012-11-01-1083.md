Today, Planar Systems, Inc. published a case study that promotes the recently announced UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) CAVE2&trade; System, which is built using both commercial and custom LCD display panels from Planar.<br><br>

Jason Leigh, EVL director, is quoted: &ldquo;Our continued investment in 2D and 3D technology using Planar 3D display technology has allowed us to provide unique environments for interactive data analysis that are also more cost-effective to develop and maintain than other display technologies. With this technology, our users are able to make better-informed decisions that can lead to significant advancements in fields such as science, medicine, energy exploration, transportation, and other infrastructure planning.&rdquo;<br><br>

This profile follows another that Planar produced earlier this year. At that time, Planar announced its 3D LCD display product - the Clarity&trade; Matrix 3D LCD video wall - a 3D ultra-thin border, flat-panel display that it developed in partnership with EVL. EVL used these panels to build its Cyber-Commons tiled display wall. Today, these panels form the cornerstone of the CAVE2&trade; System. The February 2012 case study can be found at:<br>
