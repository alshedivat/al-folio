Julio Obelleiro, EVL MFA Candidate will present his work <em>Building Music</em> at the Spark Festival of Electronic Music &amp; Arts 2009, University of Minnesota, February 17th - 22nd, 2009. The annual one week long Spark Festival brings together international new media arts creators and performers to showcase their work in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis / St. Paul (USA). This year&rsquo;s festival will showcase artists including STEIM (the studio for electroinstrumental music), Kanta Horio, Wafaa Bilal, Puzzleweasel, and Ray Lee among others.<br><br>

Obelleiro&rsquo;s <em>Building Music</em> was created in conjunction with <em>Play the Magic</em> - a large scale public interactive installation that explores the musicality of different architectural features. Participants move the light of a torch (flashlight) along the facade of a building to create musical compositions while lighting the windows. Each window hides a sound and a color for spectators to interact with from a distance.<br><br>

<em>Building Music</em> was created in collaboration with artists Alberto Garc&iacute;a, Jorge Cano and Pedro Enriquez.<br><br>

Also exhibited at:<br>
Urban Art Festival, Bucharest 9/08<br><br>
