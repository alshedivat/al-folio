I'll present our work on party-movement interactions with [Swen Hutter](https://www.swen-hutter.eu/) in two upcoming conferences. On Friday, the 3rd of September, at 9 AM (GMT+2) I will take part in the panel entitled ["The Influence of Movement Parties on Democratic Quality"](https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PanelDetails/10741){:target="_blank"} at the ECPR general conference. You can also listen to the presentation during the [Congress of the German Political Science Association (DVPW)](https://www.dvpw.de/kongress/programm){:target="_blank"} on Thursday, the 16th of September, at 14:30 PM (GMT+2) in the panel entitled "Party-movement relations from the left to the right: Between cooperation and conflict". If you are interested in reading the manuscript of our [upcoming book on the subject]({{ '/projects/party_movement_interactions/' | relative_url }}), don't hesitate to [reach out]({{ '/contact/' | relative_url }})!
