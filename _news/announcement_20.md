Our student [Maryam Almaian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maryam-almaian-83974116b/) secured a $500 Kendeda Micro Grant from the Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems. We used the funds to run validations on for a heat transfer toolkit she's building as part of her master's thesis at Georgia Tech. See her LinkedIn post [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7184935167436681216-sWPK).

Thank you to the Kendeda board and Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems for their generous support.

Congrats again, Maryam!
