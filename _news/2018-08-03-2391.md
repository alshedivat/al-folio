PhD Candidate John Novak and Prof. Kenyon&rsquo;s paper &ldquo;Effects of User Controlled Speech Rate on Intelligibility in Noisy Environments&rdquo; Interspeech 2018, in Hyderabad, India this September!<br><br>
Their paper was one of twelve nominated out of hundreds of accepted papers and over 2,500 submissions for Interspeech 2018 being held in Hyderabad, India September 2-6. Interspeech is the world&rsquo;s largest and most comprehensive conference on the science and technology of spoken language processing.<br><br>
Novak explained their research in more detail. &ldquo;The difficult situation is a type of background noise called
&lsquo;cocktail party noise,&rsquo; which is exactly what it sounds like: multiple people talking in the background of a target voice,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The computer mediated tool was a method of artificially slowing speech without causing distortion, especially without dropping the pitch of the voices. This is something that talkers do naturally [in addition to speaking louder] to help their listeners, but we wanted to put some control in the hands of the listener. We believe this is very important, although very
difficult to achieve.&rdquo;<br><br>
