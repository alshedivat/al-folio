Jason Leigh and Andy Johnson of the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) recently learned that a paper they helped co-author 14 years ago has been selected as one of the top 20 papers by the International ACM Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC).<br><br>

HPDC, now in its 21st year, is working with Omni-Press to publish a special proceedings that features the top 20 papers from the past 20 years of HPDC publications. The 1998 paper &ldquo;Application Experiences with the Globus Toolkit&rdquo; is one of them. The papers for this special proceedings were nominated by the HPDC community-at-large and then selected by a committee.<br><br>

The paper features several applications that used Globus Toolkit, middleware that simplifies the use of &ldquo;computational grids&rdquo;. EVL&rsquo;s CAVERNsoft was one of them, utilizing Nexus, the communication component of the Globus Toolkit. CAVERNsoft, or CAVE Research Network software, simplified collaborative virtual-reality sessions, enabling geographically distributed users to define, update and access shared virtual worlds.<br><br>

By the late 90s, CAVERNsoft had a strong user community that connected remote CAVE&trade; and ImmersaDesk&trade; virtual environments for collaborative problem-solving. The article highlights a few CAVERNsoft applications, notably: it was the underlying data distribution architecture for VisualEyes, a collaborative design review system used by General Motors; CAVE5D, a collaborative system for visualizing multi-dimensional weather and environmental hydrology data; Virtual Temporal Bone, a collaborative learning environment to teach medical students the structure and function of the inner ear; and TIDE (Teleimmersive Data-mining Environment), a collaborative system for viewing decision-trees generated by data-mining classifiers (see image below).<br><br>

CAVERNsoft was a unique collaboration framework for its time. EVL continues to develop advanced display technologies and the collaboration software necessary to make them useful and usable, particularly with today&rsquo;s SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment) middleware.<br><br>

EVL appreciates that HPDC selected this paper as one of its best papers for the past 20 years. A copy of the paper is available via the download link on the right (related document).<br><br>
