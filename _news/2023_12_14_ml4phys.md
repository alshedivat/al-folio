I will present a [poster](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/76253) on decomposing linear operators with neural networks at [ML4PS Workshop @NeurIPS 2023](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2023/).
The extended abstract can be found [here](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2023/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2023_225.pdf).
The full paper with code will be made available online soon!
