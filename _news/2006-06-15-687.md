<strong>Futuristic optical system tackles image processing</strong><br>
<em>OptIPuter clustering system outlined at TeraGrid &rsquo;06 conference.</em><br><br>

By Carolyn Duffy Marsan, NetworkWorld.com, 06/15/06<br><br>

A team of researchers led by the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of California at San Diego are creating an IP-based computing system for scientists who need to visualize and analyze massive amounts of data stored in multiple locations connected via optical networks.<br><br>

Dubbed the OptIPuter, the federally funded research project is focused on earth, ocean and biosciences applications, where researchers have large repositories of 2-D and 3-D images that need analysis.<br><br>

&ldquo;We are removing bandwidth as an obstacle in data-intensive sciences,&rdquo; explains Maxine Brown, project manager for the OptIPuter and associate director of the electronic visualization lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago. &ldquo;With our system, the network is a backplane, not a network.&rdquo;<br><br>

Brown gave a briefing about the OptIPuter at the TeraGrid &rsquo;06 conference held in Indianapolis this week. The conference was co-sponsored by Indiana University and Purdue University.<br><br>

Brown said scientists who need to visualize massive amounts of images need guaranteed bandwidth, guaranteed latency and guaranteed scheduling for their processing jobs?<br><br>
