The Image of Research 2013 first place winner Joshua Albers (New Media Arts) and second place winner Khairi Reda (EVL / Computer Science) are featured in UIC&rsquo;s Graduate College Fall newsletter. Over the last 5 years, the Image of Research competition has provided student researchers the opportunity to showcase their work, as well as the breadth and diversity of research at UIC.<br><br>

Albers&rsquo; image &ldquo;Threshold&rdquo; exemplifies the artists&rsquo; interest in using motion capture and stereo to create real world abstractions.  Reda&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Nanoscale Forest Seen Through a Big Lens&rdquo; documents his work in large scale data visualization in EVL&rsquo;s CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Virtual Environment.<br><br>
