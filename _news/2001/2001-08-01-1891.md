The Personal Varrier&trade; display consists of a 30&rdquo; LCD widescreen display with 2560x1600 native resolution. A photographic film barrier screen affixed to a glass panel is mounted to the front of the LCD to produce horizontal parallax.<br><br>

The barrier screen reduces the horizontal resolution, so the system essentially has approximately 640 lines of horizontal resolution and 1600 lines of vertical resolution. The horizontal angle of view is approximately 60 degrees. EVL&rsquo;s Varrier computational technique generates a real-time Virtual Reality stereo graphic experience.<br><br>

Varrier is a head-tracked autostereo virtual reality display. The display eliminates the need to wear special glasses and affords the user an effective sense of immersion.<br><br>

In the Varrier method, a virtual barrier screen is created simulating the physical barrier screen, and placed in the virtual world in front of the projection plane. An off-axis perspective projection of this barrier screen, combined with the rest of the virtual world, is projected from at least two viewpoints corresponding to the eye positions of the head-tracked viewer.<br><br>

A real-time (640x480 at 60Hz) camera-based 3D head position tracking system is currently used. The new head tracker is based on a SOM neural network system and is trainable to an individual face.
