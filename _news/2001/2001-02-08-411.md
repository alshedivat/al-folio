Entity, the Ann Arbor, MI electronic artist coalition, proudly presents immedia1901. The largest annual exhibition of new electronic and digital art in the Mid-West.<br><br>

This year we have attracted submissions from across the country and around the world. The sixth year running, immedia1901 is by far the largest most diverse showcase yet!<br><br>

This year&rsquo;s theme reflects 100 years of technological innovation: immedia1901 attempts to draw a parallel between the industrial revolution of the last turn-of-the-century with the digital revolution of this new millennium.<br><br>

We have gathered an eclectic and talented group of performers, speakers, and artists this year and are expecting it to be a unique experience for both performer and audience community.<br><br>

The exhibition will be open for viewing from 1:00 PM - 9:00 PM February 8 - 18 in the Media Union on the University of Michigan&rsquo;s North Campus located at 2281 Bonisteel Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI.
