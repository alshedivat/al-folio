With appropriate tools, models of small structures that are currently not measurable directly can be inferred from medical image data. We introduced non-invasive methods for estimating individual-specific soft-tissue geometry solely from kinematic data and bone surfaces. The approach enhances the capabilities of radiation-based imaging: we are able to capture in vivo soft-tissue information that used to be measurable only through invasive means.
