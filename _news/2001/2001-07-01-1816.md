<em>Beat Box</em> presents networked CAVE&trade; participants with a playful arena of interactive virtual sound machines.<br><br>

Each of three machines has a unique periodic duration and controls, respectively, tones or notes, ambient loops and bass sounds.<br><br>

<em>Beat Box</em> is virtual sonic chronometry as the environment is enveloped in keeping time with the sound machines.<br><br>

Participants cycle through sound selections and give voice to a sound by introducing it to a thoroughly odd indigenous head. Each head represents a distinct interval in a scale that contributes to the resultant delivery of the collective instruments.
