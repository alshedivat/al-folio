LambdaRAM (Optically Connected Memory Cache) is an application being developed to address long-haul latency in optical networks.<br><br>

LambdaRAM is a tool that aggregates pools of memory in clusters of gigabit-connected computers to provide a massive data cache. This minimizes access latency when data-intensive applications need to fetch data from distantly located data stores.<br><br>

LambdaRAM utilizes available network bandwidth to aggressively prefetch data before an application needs it. Applications access LambdaRAM via an API that provides a single contiguous memory image. LambdaRAM is currently used in TeraScope (EVL&rsquo;s visual data mining software) to provide data correlation algorithms with fast access to distributed database tables.
