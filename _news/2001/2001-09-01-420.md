<em>&ldquo;Which constellations, which factors are defining the art of tomorrow, where will it happen, who is doing it and with whom?<br><br>

The altered framework conditions that effect working as an artist and the impact of art in a world characterized by information and communications technologies have given rise to new forms of art. Significant here is the shift of their presence into spheres beyond the conventional art world and also increasingly into the emerging economies that have been geo-culturally uncharted territory for media art&rdquo;.</em><br><br>
