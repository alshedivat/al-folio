As part of the iGrid Research Demonstration at INET 2000, we created two Virtual Cultural Heritage environments - &ldquo;Virtual Harlem&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shared Miletus&rdquo;. The purpose of these applications was to explore possibilities in using the combination of high-speed international networks and virtual reality (VR) displays for cultural heritage education. Our ultimate goal is to enable the construction of tele-immersive museums and classes.<br><br>

In this paper we present an overview of the infrastructure used for these applications, and some details of their construction.
