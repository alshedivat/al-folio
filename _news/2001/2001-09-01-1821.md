## Application of Intelligent Signaling and Control of Dynamically Switched Optical Networks

The proposed software development efforts will leverage the significant potential of a newly installed metro optical testbed for application-level dynamic control of resource discovery, allocation and adjustment. Efforts at many levels are required to make such flexibility available in service provisioning, infrastructure and service resource management:<br>
<ul>
<li>Research into the behavior of advanced scientific applications, not just on extremely high-performance optical network, but on one that can be dynamically adjusted at a granular level</li>
<li>Identify application-level networking requirements, investigate management techniques for optical networks, and study new service provisioning models related to application needs</li>
<li>Research new methods for application signaling</li>
<li>Investigate interconnections between application signaling and IP-based control-plane methods, such as through GMPLS</li>
<li>Test deployment of those techniques on an advanced testbed and analyze results</li>
<li>Experiment with multiple-service provisioning to ensure gateways to traditional networks and protocols</li>
<li>Develop a system for performance metrics, monitoring and analysis</li>
<li>Create a testbed for <a href='http://www.startap.net/starlight'>StarLight</a>, the next-generation, optically based <a href='http://www.startap.net'>STAR TAP</a>, and for other advanced research networks</li>
</ul><br>

The testbed for this project is an a four-node optical network, OMNInet, initially linking a core node on Northwestern University&rsquo;s Chicago campus with a node at the University of Illinois at Chicago, the Canadian Network for the Advancement of Research, Industry and Education (CANARIE) CA*net4 node at its Chicago Point of Presence and a node at Northwestern&rsquo;s Evanston campus. The sites are separated by distances of 5 to 20 miles, connected by dedicated technology trial-fiber service provided by SBC / Ameritech. Each node includes a Nortel Networks WDM photonic switch, an Optical Fiber Amplifier (OFA) and high performance router / switches. These sites will also have access to Nortel and SBC / Ameritech testing personnel, expertise, and equipment. Participants in this project, led by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, include the <a href='http://www.icair.org'>International Center for Advanced Internet Research</a> at Northwestern University, <a href='http://www.canarie.ca/'>CANARIE</a>, <a href='http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/division/welcome/default.asp'>Argonne National Laboratory</a>, <a href='http://www.mren.org/'>MREN</a> (Metropolitan Area Research and Education Network), Nortel and Ameritech.
