Shared Miletus is a networked Virtual Cultural Heritage application first demonstrated at the INET 2000 conference.<br><br>

In this application we sought to explore new tools and techniques, ones that could be useful to create a networked virtual environment, which takes the place of a traditional museum.<br><br>

This paper describes the software used to build the environment, and the virtual tools created specifically to support remote, international visitors to the exhibition.
