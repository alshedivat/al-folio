<em>Excavation</em> is a networked virtual environment that explores the mediated surface of historiography.<br><br>

<em>Excavation</em> immerses its visitors in a metaphoric archeology of encounter, wherein their presence engenders temporally unique and continually adaptive sets of relationships between the networked participants, the fluctuating anatomy of the metaphoric landscape, and its multitudinous inhabitants.<br><br>

These inhabitants constitute a subjective aggregate of modern history as captured and conditioned by the technological apparatus of post-industrial society.<br><br>

Alive on the Grid, visitors are recorded and become virtual inhabitants extending and re-contextualizing the history of &ldquo;Excavation&rdquo;.<br><br>
