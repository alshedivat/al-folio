The Summer 2010 issues of &ldquo;access&rdquo; magazine and the &ldquo;Blue Waters Project Quarterly Newsletter,&rdquo; both published by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, have articles announcing the newly elected members of the Executive Committee of the Great Lakes Consortium for Petascale Computing (GLCPC).<br><br>

Notably, at the annual May meeting of the GLCPC Board of Directors, Maxine Brown, associate director of the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory, was elected GLCPC President for a one-year term. The latter publication also has an article &ldquo;GLCPC Outlines Goals for Coming Year.&rdquo;<br><br>

The &ldquo;access&rdquo; magazine is not yet online.<br><br>

UIC is a founding member of the <a href="http://www.greatlakesconsortium.org">Great Lakes Consortium</a> for Petascale Computing (GLCPC), which is a non-profit multi-institutional effort to promote petascale computing and applications.<br><br>

EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: <em>Public relations people always say that &ldquo;ink is ink,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s better to get mentioned, even if there are errors, than not mentioned at all. The &ldquo;access&rdquo; magazine article has the wrong Iowa State University person listed as an executive committee member; it should be Srinivas Aluru. The &ldquo;Blue Waters&rdquo; article correctly lists the GLCPC executive committee.</em>
Maxine Brown
