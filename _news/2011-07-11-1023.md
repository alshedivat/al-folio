On July 11, 2011, the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) posted a short video of the game <em>Fleet Commander</em>, developed by EVL graduate student Arthur Nishimoto, on its YouTube page. As of today, the video has gone viral - and has more than 275,000 hits! News articles about the video appear in several online publications.<br><br>

<em>Fleet Commander</em>, an homage to the epic battles in Star Wars&rsquo; Return of the Jedi, is more than an entertaining game. It is a real-time interactive application developed by Nishimoto to create and test features for the multi-user touch screen overlay that EVL had purchased and installed on its large, tiled display wall, named Cyber-Commons. Access to new large-format display technologies such as Cyber-Commons and new multi-user, multi-touch input devices motivate EVL students to develop new user-interaction techniques and to advance computer science research. By working with applications, EVL students are assured that what they develop is useful and useable to diverse user communities.<br><br>

Luke Plunkett, of the publication Kotaku, says &ldquo;Forget everything you know about Star Wars&rsquo; games. The ones that used control pads, mice or keyboards. Because Fleet Commander, a student project, might just blow them all out the airlock&hellip; it&rsquo;s like seeing a childhood dream of the perfect video game come to life.&rdquo;<br><br>

While EVL received notoriety in 1977 for helping develop the computer graphics &ldquo;briefing room&rdquo; scene for the first Star Wars&rsquo; movie, today&rsquo;s faculty, staff and students continue to be fans of the Star Wars&rsquo; universe.
