The SAGE&trade; team at the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) is excited to announce that as of November 5, 2013, they have signed an agreement licensing SAGE to Vadiza Inc., for commercial sales, development and use on a global basis. EVL recently received renewed funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to focus on future SAGE innovations, so is turning over day-to-day support responsibilities for SAGE technical support to Vadiza, Inc.<br><br>

Vadiza welcomes all SAGE users, contributors and interested parties to contact them to discuss improvements to SAGE, address any outstanding user needs / requests, and to grow the global community supporting and strengthening SAGE in government, academic and commercial settings. Vadiza can be contacted by phone at +1.855.344.8400 or by e-mail at info @ vadiza.com. Or, visit <a href="http://www.vadiza.com">www.vadiza.com</a> to learn more about software, appliances and technical support options.<br><br>

A press release announcing the EVL / Vadiza partnership and future plans will be distributed under separate cover.<br><br>

Vadiza is participating in the SC13 SAGE BOF, so please attend to learn more. (For those not coming to SC13, additional information will be sent out after the BOF.)<br><br>
