What a week it was at [#SimBuild](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=simbuild&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7199948566050545664) in Denver! Great to have made so many new connections, reunite with ESLab Cornell folks, and to see where all our Georgia Tech alumi ended up across the US and all around the globe!

[Hung Ming Tseng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAADbTmtMBR8SUwUvtIfPADSFBHhHnkMnKP6A), [Amber Su](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amber-su-383075218/), and [Kewei Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kewei-xu-4185531b7/) presented our research titled "Impact and Cost Analysis of Thermal Load Electrification Measures using Automated Urban Building Energy Modeling in Ithaca, NY" led by [Timur Dogan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timur-dogan-b28340a9/).

I'm also happy to announce that the precursor Journal paper on this topic (essentially my postdoc) has just been accepted in is currently in production with [Elsevier](https://lnkd.in/eXpKmCsp)!

I also chaired a technical session on Grid Interactions and Distributed Energy Resources with awesome presentations by [Maharshi Pathak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maharshi-pathak-/), [Daniel Villa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-villa-3b999b78/), [Tuğçin Kırant Mitić](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tu%C4%9F%C3%A7in-k%C4%B1rant-miti%C4%87-70283b15b/), [Zhanwei He](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhanwei-he157b48139/), [Caitlin E Anderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlin-e-anderson-86957431/).

Thank you to all organizers and I hope to see everyone again in Brisbane next summer!
