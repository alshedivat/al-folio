Shreyas developed an application for the CAVE2 and Microsoft HoloLens to investigate whether these technologies could be used effectively to teach music to a novice. Both applications taught the user &lsquo;Mary Had a Little Lamb&rsquo; on the viola, graphically representing the correct bow direction, tempo, fingering, and sheet music. Additional application features included adjustable tempo and metronome functionality. Combining graphical visual cues while seeing the physical instrument in a mixed reality environment proved to be a powerful method for independent music instruction.
