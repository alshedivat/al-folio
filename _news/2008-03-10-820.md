Design Visualization Laboratory Workshop Series Presents: <br>
Session 5 - Computer Vision<br><br>

SPEAKER: Julio Obelleiro<br>
Monday, March 10 2008, 6-9 pm<br>
@ Design Visualization Lab<br>
Room #3325 - Art + Architecture Building<br>
845 West Harrison St.<br><br>

This workshop will introduce how computer vision techniques can be used to create interactive artistic installations. It will cover different interactive techniques with artificial vision using video cameras, motion detection, and position tracking. Attendees will use processing to develop sound and image examples that include real-time manipulation.<br><br>

Workshops are open to students, faculty, and staff.  Class seats are limited, so please RSVP to Tesia (tkosma2 @ uic.edu) by March 8th.<br><br>

The instructor, Julio Obelleiro, is pursuing a Ph.D. in the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at UIC. He is currently researching new means of interaction based on computer vision and has been working for the last three years as an artificial intelligence programmer. His works have been exhibited in venues such as the Ars Electronica Festival (Austria), 10Years_After (Korea) and La Noche en Blanco (Spain).<br><br>

The Design Visualization Laboratory (DVL) is a shared high-tech computational studio operating under the Electronic Visualization and Industrial Design programs.<br><br>

The 2007/08 DVL Workshop series is organized by Tesia Kosmalski (MFA candidate, EV).
