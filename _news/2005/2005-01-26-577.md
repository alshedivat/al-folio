The OptIPuter annual All Hands Meeting is a three-day meeting, to be held January 26-28, during which participants from all 11 NSF-funded and affiliate academic partners sites from across the U.S. and Europe will meet to discuss the OptIPuter&rsquo;s third year&rsquo;s progress and update work plans, timelines, and deliverables.<br><br>

The OptIPuter is a powerful distributed cyberinfrastructure to support data-intensive scientific research and collaboration. It has two application drivers the NIH Biomedical Informatics Research Network and the NSF EarthScope where scientists are generating multi-gigabytes of 3D volumetric data objects that reside on distributed archives that they want to correlate, analyze, and visualize.<br><br>

The OptIPuter is being designed as a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; parallel computer in which the individual &ldquo;processors&rdquo; are widely distributed clusters; the &ldquo;memory&rdquo; is in the form of large distributed data repositories; &ldquo;peripherals&rdquo; are very-large scientific instruments, visualization displays and/or sensor arrays; and the &ldquo;motherboard&rdquo; uses standard IP delivered over multiple dedicated lambdas.<br><br>
