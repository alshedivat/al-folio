On February 25-26, EVL computer science graduate student Saleha Rizvi is attending the Computing Research Association&rsquo;s Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W) 2005 Grad Cohort Workshop, in San Francisco, CA. The program aims to increase the ranks of senior women in the fields of computer science and engineering by building and mentoring nationwide cohorts of women through their graduate studies, as they make the transition from student to researcher.<br><br>

The Grad Cohort Workshop is an opportunity to network with senior computing researchers by engaging in informal discussions and formal presentations designed to build mentoring relationships and develop peer networks through exposure to a variety of professional role models.
