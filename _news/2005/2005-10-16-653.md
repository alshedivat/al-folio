EVL graduate student and research assistant Arun Rao attended the Geological Society of America (GSA) 2005 Annual Meeting and Exposition at Salt Lake City, Utah to demonstrate the CoreWall application running on a Personal GeoWall-2 (PG-2). The Personal GeoWall-2 is a high resolution display device driven by a single PC, which was developed by researchers at EVL. CoreWall takes advantage of the PG-2&rsquo;s capabilities to display high resolution geological data &ldquo;core imagery&rdquo; to create a Virtual Core Description (VCD) workspace. The demonstration was supported and held at the Joint Oceanographic Insitutions (JOI) booth. JOI is a $600-million program in charge of the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s ocean drilling expeditions, which produce thousands of meters of core per expedition.
