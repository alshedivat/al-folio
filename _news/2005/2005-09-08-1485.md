To explore new methods of interaction with large scientific datasets, we have developed a high resolution visualization table. This system merges table interaction and Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) with current tiled display technology.<br><br>

We discuss the advantages of tiled Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) systems over projector based displays, and present the LambdaTable, our implementation of a tiled LCD table. We also discuss camera tracking of tangible interface devices on the table, and present a system for validating this interface against Fitts Law.
