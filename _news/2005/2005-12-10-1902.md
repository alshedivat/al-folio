PAVIS: Pervasive Adaptive Visualization and Interaction Service is an adaptive system intended to automatically generate resource-aware visualizations and context-sensitive user-interfaces that are best suited for the display devices using rule-based techniques. Based on the user&rsquo;s environment, display devices may vary widely from a cell-phone, desktop computers to high-resolution tiled displays. A context sensitive environment may respond to changes in visualization or data content by accommodating techniques to change the interface at run-time.
