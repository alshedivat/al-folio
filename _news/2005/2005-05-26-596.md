EVL alumnus and Assistant Professor in the Department of Media Study of the University at Buffalo, Dave Pape collaborated with artist Jackie Matisse on &ldquo;Art Flying In &amp; Out of Space&rdquo;,now on exhibit at <a href="http://www.zonechelsea.org">ZONE: Chelsea Center for the Arts</a>, through June 24, 2005. The piece appears along with other Jackie Matisse works spanning 20 years, including her famous hand-made kites and kite tails, mobiles, collages, assemblages, and graphic works. Also on exhibit are video presentations of her collaborative projects, including &ldquo;Tailing a Dream&rdquo; with composer David Tudor and film maker Molly Davies.<br><br>

Matisse&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kites Flying In &amp; Out of Space&rdquo; was originally developed in collaboration with NCSA, EVL / UIC, and Virginia Tech as a CAVE application for iGrid2002 in Amsterdam. It explored the physical properties of flying kites in virtual reality whose movements were driven by the bandwidth usage of several collaborative applications running over high-speed networks.<br><br>

Matisse&rsquo;s &ldquo;Art Flying In &amp; Out of Space&rdquo; is a flat-screen, interactive stereoscopic installation, which continues her experimental work in supercomputing and virtual reality.<br><br>

The exhibition will open with a reception for the artist on Thursday, May 26th, from 6:00pm - 8:00pm Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday, 10:00am - 5:00pm.<br><br>
