<strong>TransLight / StarLight&#8480;</strong> and <strong>TransLight / Pacific Wave&#8480;</strong> are complementary efforts funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) to provide multi-gigabit links and supporting infrastructure to interconnect U.S., European and Pacific Rim research and education networks, and to supplement the available bandwidth that is being provided by other countries.<br><br>

These efforts are part of the NSF&rsquo;s International Research Network Connections (IRNC) program to assist the U.S. research and education community by:<br>
<ul>
<li>Funding international network links between U.S. and foreign science and engineering communities</li>
<li>Encouraging the use of advanced architectures</li>
<li>Supporting advanced science and engineering requirements</li>
<li>Encouraging the development and leveraging of deployed infrastructure to meet current and anticipated needs</li>
<li>Enabling network engineers to engage in system and technology</li>
<li>Demonstrations and rigorous experimentation</li>
</ul><br>

In cooperation with U.S. and European National Research Networks, <strong>TransLight / StarLight&#8480;</strong> is implementing a strategy to best serve established U.S. and European production science, including usage by those scientists, engineers and educators who have persistent large-flow, real-time, and/or other advanced application requirements.
