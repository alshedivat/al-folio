MagicCarpet is a cluster-based ultra-high-resolution image viewer for scalable tiled displays. Unlike JuxtaView, MagicCarpet uses pre-processed multi-resolution images that reside on local disk. The software loads appropriate detail at different zoom levels by paging texture data to video memory on demand.<br><br>

The aim of MagicCarpet is to provide interactive rendering of large data that be suitable for fast-paced and demanding settings such as museums. MagicCarpet supports entirely local and remote user interfaces. The choice of a particular interface may depend on the context of use. In addition to multi-resolution, time dependent datasets can also be displayed by the software.<br><br>

MagicCarpet uses VTK to visualize data and it can work as a standalone application or render to <a href='http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/sage/index.php'>SAGE</a> tiled display manager. Future versions of MagicCarpet may allow on-demand generation of levels of detail without the requirement of pre-processing when integrated with <a href='http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/optistore/'>OptiStore</a>.
