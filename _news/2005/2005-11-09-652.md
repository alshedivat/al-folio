EVL&rsquo;s LambdaVision featured in the UIC News&hellip; &ldquo;A Pack of Pixels&rdquo;&hellip;<br><br>

Researchers marvel at a 105 megapixel ultra-high resolution image of Chicago on LambdaVision, a tiled, scalable display consisting of 55 flat screen monitors that together stretch 17 feet wide and stand 6 feet tall. Developed by UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory, LamdaVision is a Natrional Science Foundation-funded project to learn how to write visualization software and develop user interfaces for scalable displays. Likely users of such collaborative work displays include academic researchers, as well as customers in the public and private business sectors.
