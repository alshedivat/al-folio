Research assistant Arun Rao presented a poster and demonstrated an updated CoreWall system at the Joint Oceanographic Institutions&rsquo; booth at the American Geophysical Union&rsquo;s (AGU) Fall Meeting held in San Francisco. Taking advantage of high resolution displays, CoreWall presents an integration of images, data and interpretations.  With plugin capabilities available, development outside of EVL has begun.
