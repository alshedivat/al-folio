<strong>A Passive Stereo Virtual Reality System Using Circularly Polarized High Resolution LCD Panels</strong><br><br>

The ImmersaDesk4&trade; (IDesk4&trade;) is built from 2 Apple 30&rdquo; 2560 x 1600 LCD panels mounted with quarter-wave plates in front of the LCD panels to achieve circular polarization. The LCD panels are bisected by a half-silvered mirror which reverses the polarization of the top LCD panel. The circular polarization facilitates viewing stereoscopic images even while the head is tilted.<br><br>

An optional 3D position and orientation tracking system can be attached to allow the computer graphics to project the correct viewer-centered stereoscopic imagery based on the user&rsquo;s head position and orientation.<br><br>
