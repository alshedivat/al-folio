Dan Davidson will present <em>Pure Illusion, Pure Beauty</em>, a solo exhibition of wall paintings, video works, and a web site as his MFA Thesis presentation.<br><br>

This art exhibition carries two themes: Point-Perspective Spacial Systems (Pure Illusion) and Visualizations of the Pythagorean Theorem (Pure Beauty). These two themes are mediated by wall paintings, two short videos, and a web site. Each of these three media displays something different about these two very powerful, very old mathematical concepts.<br><br>

Opening Reception: Friday, April 23, 6-9 pm<br>
Exhibition: Saturday, May 24, 1-7 pm
