StarLight&#8480;; the optical STAR TAP&trade;, is an advanced optical infrastructure and proving ground for network services optimized for high-performance applications.<br><br>

Operational since summer 2001, StarLight&#8480; is a 1GigE and 10GigE switch / router facility for high-performance access to participating networks and will ultimately become a true optical switching facility for wavelengths.<br><br>

StarLight&#8480; is being developed by EVL / UIC, the International Center for Advanced Internet Research (<a href='http://www.icair.org/'>iCAIR</a>) at <a href='http://www.northwestern.edu/'>Northwestern University</a>, and the Mathematics and Computer Science Division (MCS) at Argonne National Laboratory, in partnership with Canada&rsquo;s <a href='http://www.canarie.ca/'>CANARIE</a> and the Netherlands&rsquo; <a href='http://www.surfnet.nl/en/'>SURFnet</a>.<br><br>
