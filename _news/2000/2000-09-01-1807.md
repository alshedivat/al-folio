Home is an interactive, navigable virtual-reality environment that explores ideas about dwelling and its relation to the psyche. In it, a house abandoned by its owners, is up for sale. Half-empty spaces still reverberate with memories and the most private moments of its previous inhabitants. Deceptively normal looking from the outside, once inside, spaces stretch and break apart and walls fall away, leaving only a small plateau hanging in emptiness, resounding with the lives and voices of those who still haunt it.<br><br>

The rooms and hallways include a soundscape composed of spoken narrative fragments and a musical ambient score. Immersants may encounter the ghostly presence of other voyagers in the space, and may leave a recording of their voice for future visitors.<br><br>

Home began as an on-line VRML environment, and was remade for the CAVE&reg; environment. It contains links to the work of numerous artists who reflect on the meaning of domestic space and identity, including a screenwriter, photographer, set designer, film and video makers, and computer artists. Each brings a unique perspective on the meaning of home, this most universal and basic of necessities.<br><br>
