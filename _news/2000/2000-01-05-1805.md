This networked virtual reality CAVE&trade; application explores a wonderland inspired by Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s popular story.<br><br>

The VR artist lures the visitor into making the environment his or her own fantasy realm by rearranging it. Rows and rows of blue mushrooms appear everywhere for the visitor to pick. Forty-foot rabbits appear and disappear, and self-portraits of the artist as a blue-faced spirit or a crazed, yellow-haired Alice character with a Cheshire Cat-like grin randomly pop-up. <br><br>

An original vocal and string arrangement provide an eerie accompaniment to this mesmerizing environment.<br><br>
