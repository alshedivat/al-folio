<em>Infinite Studio</em> is a new paradigm of &ldquo;art-making,&rdquo; that allows the user to create, in real-time, interactive virtual reality artwork from inside a virtual environment.<br><br>

Using a color palette and several drawing and modeling tools, the user can create and modify virtual objects for any effect desired.<br><br>

Individuals can also collaborate across the network to create group constructions. The scenes can be easily scaled, rotated or moved from one part of the world to another, thereby changing focus or eliminating elements. Every line drawn has a lifespan causing the entire art piece to constantly evolve.
