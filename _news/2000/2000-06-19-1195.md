There exists a number of scientific visualization systems designed to provide a two-dimensional interface to the user. However, little consideration has been given to the development of collaborative virtual environment for visualization purposes. This paper discusses the Tele-Immersive Data Explorer, a generalizable framework to facilitate the construction of domain-specific data exploration applications challennged with the problem of having to visualize massive data-sets immersively and collaboratively. In the paper, we describe the framework&rsquo;s conceptual organization, its distributed multiprocessed object-oriented architecture, and its application to visualize gridded scalar data.
