La Bo&icirc;te is a networked virtual environment where visitors are invited to see short dance performances on video screens.<br><br>

In the virtual dance studio, visitors can view brief performances, than try to imitate them or leave their own traces of a performance. The piece places some emphasis on classical ballet training and the importance of the geography of the classical dance studio.<br><br>

This project was inspired by a decade-long friendship, and our mutual love of dance, performance and technology.<br><br>
