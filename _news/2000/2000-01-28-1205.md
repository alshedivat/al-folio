In this paper we discuss issues involved in creating art and cultural heritage projects in Virtual Reality with particular reference to one interactive narrative, &ldquo;The Thing Growing&rdquo;. In the first section we will briefly discuss the potential of VR as a medium for the production of art and the interpretation of culture. In the second section we describe &ldquo;The Thing Growing&rdquo; project. In the third section we discuss building an interactive narrative in VR using XP, an authoring system we designed to simplify the process of producing projects in VR. In the fourth section we will discuss some issues involved in presenting art and cultural heritage projects in VR.
