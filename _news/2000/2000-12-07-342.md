Todd Margolis, EVL MFA candidate joins a team of artists to develop <a href="http://www.hometransfer.org">HOME TRANSFER</a>, a Web project by Pat Badani.  The site has been selected by ISEA 2000, and will be shown during the Symposium in Paris, France from December 7th to 10th.<br><br>

<em>Home Transfer</em> explores the intersection of home, architecture and new technologies. A dwelling made of bread and its parasitic invasion is used to investigate changing notions of place and presence. Host / Guest relations are established between artist, architects and people online.<br><br>

The site features streaming video of architects discussing a cultural paradigm where technology affects aspects of domestic life in new ways. Visitors may share thoughts in two guest books provided for this purpose. The aim is to build a space for speculation where people can express their excitement and/or anxiety about this topic.<br><br>

Videos and other elements are renewed regularly. Two archives record an evolving discourse.
