Organized for the US Department of Energy VIEWS (<em>Visualization and Interactive Environments for Weapons Simulation</em>) program.<br><br>

The Advanced Projector Consortium, consisting of researchers and managers from Department of Energy (DoE) National Laboratories and National Science Foundation Supercomputing Centers, is tasked with developing a five-year specification (&ldquo;road map&rdquo;) for new computer displays (&ldquo;large-format next-generation projection technology&rdquo;) to meet the research and development needs of US laboratories, universities and industry. This road map will be part of a white paper to the DoE&rsquo;s VIEWS program management, and will contain a request for support of substantial non-recurring engineering (NRE) funds for selected companies.
