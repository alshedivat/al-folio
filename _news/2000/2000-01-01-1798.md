This virtual environment is the first of a planned series based on the works of French poet Charles Baudelaire. The poetry serves as a conceptual framework, with formal and symbolic aspects sublimated into the substance of a virtual &ldquo;landscape.&rdquo;<br><br>

This &ldquo;landscape&rdquo; functions as a quiescent space, the subtle shifts in light and atmosphere structuring the immersant&rsquo;s experience. These mercurial relationships address the fragile interpenetration of language, sound, and vision.
