[whu-on] is comprised of four distinct, but interrelated virtual environments depicting pivotal moments from the artist&rsquo;s childhood and adolescence.<br><br>

Combining metamorphic characters and imagery from popular fairy tales, feelings of abandonment, confusion and alienation are expressed. The work is designed to provoke the user to reflect on personal life-altering moments.
