<em>syn.aesthetic</em> is a virtual-reality environment where a 3D score is created by the sonic input of the participants.<br><br>

This &ldquo;objectified&rdquo; sound manifests as a visible, virtual object that maintains the location, dynamism and organic qualities of the audible sound, but persists beyond the lifetime of the sound.<br><br>

Participants are able to create their own sound sculpture by adding and deleting sounds. Each user leaves their own trace in the space, contributing to a larger sculpture, or score, representative of the collaborative effort of all participants over time.<br><br>

The disconnect between sonic creation and visual composition should lead to a new kind of creation possible only in this kind of environment; a living sculpture, where sound is the physical material and the material is ethereal.
