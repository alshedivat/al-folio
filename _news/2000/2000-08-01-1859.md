<em>Hydra Flower</em> is a 3-dimensional environment consisting of a baby monster flower, inspired by the <em>Lernaean Hydra</em> of Greek Mythology, a serpent-like chthonic water beast with numerous heads.<br><br>

In the VR environment, <em>Hydra Flower</em> has serpents as stems and nine heads as blossoms, and subsists on evil humans for nourishment. The more evil it extinguishes, the more beautiful it grows, having the potential to become a complete, adult flower.
