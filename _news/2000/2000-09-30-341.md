EVL, in collaboration with UIC&rsquo;s English Department and the Advanced Technology Center at the University of Missouri, hosted a reception and &ldquo;Virtual Harlem&rdquo; CAVE&reg; demos for MOBE 2000 conference attendees (Marketing Opportunities in Black Entertainment).<br><br>

Tele-Collaborative Virtual Harlem is a virtual reality application designed to supplement African American literature courses at the University of Missouri-Columbia and the University of Illinois at Chicago.<br><br>

The application gives students a &ldquo;portal&rdquo; to the Harlem Renaissance that began in the 1920&rsquo;s. This virtual environment allows students to walk through the streets of Harlem, and hear a sampling of the music written and popularized during the period. The application also allows students from around the world to meet and interact in the same virtual space.<br><br>

Future phases will allow students to enter buildings, peer through windows, eavesdrop on conversations and interact with historical characters.<br><br>

Virtual Harlem was developed in part by University of Missouri&rsquo;s Bryan Carter; Carter is a MOBE &ldquo;Influencers and Innovators&rdquo; award recipient for 2000.
