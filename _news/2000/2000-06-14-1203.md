Design rationale and user experience are described for a virtual ambient environment designed to support sixth grade students&rsquo; learning of simple co-occurrence relationships and systematic observational skills.<br><br>

User experience was characterized by enthusiasm, but with significant data loss and navigational difficulties. Design implications and further extensions of virtual ambient environments are suggested.
