iGrid 2000, the International Grid, demonstrates how the power of today&rsquo;s research networks enables access to remote computing resources, distribution of digital media, and collaboration with distant colleagues.<br><br>

The concept of connecting geographically distant computing resources and people seamlessly, efficiently and routinely over high-performance networks is itself a major research topic, as computer scientists and application scientists worldwide prototype the 21st-century advanced computational infrastructure, or &lsquo;grid&rsquo;.<br><br>

iGrid highlights both the achievements in grid architecture development, and the advancements it enables in science, engineering, cultural heritage, art and architecture, media communications and distance education.<br><br>

iGrid features 24 applications from 14 regions Canada, CERN, Germany, Greece, Japan, Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom and the United States with emphasis on tele-immersion, large datasets, distributed computing, remote instrumentation, collaboration, human / computer interfaces, streaming media, digital video and high-definition television.<br><br>

Applications are presented on impressive display technologies: the CAVE&trade; virtual-reality theater developed by the University of Illinois at Chicago, the Super-High Definition movie system from NTT Network Innovation Laboratory, and the Access Grid presentation environment developed by Argonne National Laboratory. Two ImmersaDesks&trade; as well as plasma displays also showcase applications in virtual-reality (stereoscopic) or large-screen (monoscopic) mode.<br><br>

iGrid is connected to the JGN, the WIDE Project Network (in cooperation with NTT, TTNet and PNJC), APAN and the APAN / TransPAC (100 Mbps) link to STAR TAP&#8480; - the international, interconnection point in Chicago, Illinois.
