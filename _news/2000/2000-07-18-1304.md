N*Vector (Networked Virtual Environment Collaboration Trans-Oceanic Research) is a project to develop innovative networked virtual reality technologies to support transoceanic collaboration. The project is currently being conducted between Japan and the United States, but the results can be generalized to other long-distance collaborative situations. In this paper we present one of the goals of N*VECTOR, to develop tools to bridge time zone differences.
