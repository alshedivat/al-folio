&ldquo;When the explorer is ready the guide will appear.&rdquo;<br><br>

- Himalayan Saying<br><br>

LARA (Laboratory for Analyzing and Reconstructing Artifacts) is an application for developing collaborative walkthroughs of large virtual environments. LARA was designed specifically to facilitate EVL&rsquo;s development of applications related to virtual restorations and recreations of cultural and historic sites.<br><br>

LARA will allow users to traverse massive landscapes whose geometric parts may be located on distant distributed servers.<br><br>

LARA will also allow the creation of annotations that will allow past visitors to leave fully animated messages for new visitors. This same technology will allow world builders to create interactive tours of the environments.
