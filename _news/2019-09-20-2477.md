Therapeutic games play an increasingly important role in modern healthcare. Games have been used to treat a broad spectrum of individuals, including patients with dementia, stroke, ADHD, cancer, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to name a few. We will survey autism research and evidence-based case studies. This workshop introduces participants to the fundamentals of therapeutic game development with a focus on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and mental health applications.<br><br>
Participants are introduced to scripting and develop a simple mental health game using the popular Unity game engine. They work in teams and are involved in problem-solving discussions to design a game to benefit people with autism. Participants share reflections and discuss how contemporary technologies can inspire novel forms of healthcare.<br><br>
An introduction to the basics of coding and scripting, designed for participants with no prior programming experience but an enthusiasm to learn about therapeutic games.<br><br>
