The UIC Office of the Chancellor, wanting to produce a promotional Welcome Video for new students with a &ldquo;wow&rdquo; factor - turned to the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) to utilize its technology. The video, &ldquo;Virtually Anything is Possible at UIC,&rdquo; is to be shown online and at different events, to promote the quality and value of UIC to potential and new students, alumni, donors and the public.<br><br>

Different campus offices were asked to suggest current students to be interviewed, and three were selected. In the video, these students use multimedia (pictures, slides, movies) to present their stories of how UIC is enriching their lives, both professionally and personally. Using EVL&rsquo;s SAGE&trade; software to display and interact with their multimedia content on EVL&rsquo;s large Cyber-Commons tiled display wall, the students each tell their stories.<br><br>

This Welcome Video was recently shown at the University of Illinois Board Meeting on January 23, 2014, and is now available on <a href="http://youtu.be/6jKguXOAzhs">YouTube</a>.<br><br>

<em>Note: SAGE software is being developed at UIC, and is now used by scientists at institutions around the world. SAGE is a trademark of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.</em>
UIC student Osamah Hasan uses SAGE in EVL&rsquo;s Cyber-Commons to describe his experience at UIC.
