The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has named Oliver Yu as a recipient of the 2003 <a href="http://www.ostp.gov/html/pecase2002.html">DOE Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers</a>.<br><br>

Established by The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), the award is intended to recognize and honor outstanding scientists and engineers at the outset of their independent research careers. The Presidential Award is the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. government on outstanding scientists and engineers beginning their independent careers. The awards will be conferred annually at the White House following recommendations from participating agencies.<br><br>

The Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), established in 1996, honors the most promising young researchers in the nation within their fields. Eight federal departments and agencies, which join together annually to nominate young scientists and engineers whose work is of greatest benefit to the nominating agency&rsquo;s mission, administer the awards. Participating agencies award these young scientists and engineers up to five years of funding to further their research in support of critical government missions.
