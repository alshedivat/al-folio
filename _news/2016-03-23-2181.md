The Chicago Tribune&rsquo;s Blue Sky Innovation section today featured Victor Mateevitsi, a University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Computer Science PhD candidate, and his work on SpiderSense. Here are excerpts from the article &ldquo;Can a Spider-Man-inspired jacket help the blind get around Chicago?&rdquo; by reporter Ally Marotti.<br><br>
SpiderSense &ldquo;allows you to feel the environment around you. It scans for people or objects, and it vibrates,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The vibrations increase as you get closer to the object. … If someone is following me, I can feel them.&rdquo;<br><br>
He says the SpiderSense jacket could help prevent injury among people with visual impairments, or help firefighters find openings in a smoke-filled building with low visibility. Mateevitsi is working with the Chicago Lighthouse, a nonprofit providing rehabilitation services for people with visual impairments, on improving SpiderSense.<br><br>
His doctoral adviser, Andrew Johnson, pointed to eyeglasses as an example of an early augmented device. &ldquo;It’s something that&rsquo;s so ingrained in our lives it doesn&rsquo;t look odd to see someone walking down the street with eyeglasses,&rdquo; said Johnson, the director of research at the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory and a Computer Science Associate Professor. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the angle we&rsquo;re trying to take with this. … What we&rsquo;re trying to focus on is not so much trying to regain an ability, but how can we add something.&rdquo;<br><br>
Mateevitsi is scheduled to pitch at Technori&rsquo;s maker-themed showcase on Tuesday, March 29.<br><br>

Mateevitsi&rsquo;s SpiderSense jacket, filled with sensors and inspired by Spider-Man, was recently featured on the <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/entry.php?id=2160">Science Channel&rsquo;s &ldquo;All-American Makers.&rdquo;</a>
Victor Mateevitsi created the SpiderSense jacket to vibrate when something, or someone, is close.
