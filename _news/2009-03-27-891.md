EVL MFA graduate, AnnMarie Cernoch will showcase a series of animated shorts and discusses her approach to developing art and technology at the <em>Illinois Women Video Artists</em>, Illinois State Museum, Chicago Gallery.<br><br>

Cernoch will discuss <em>Replication of System</em>, a project creating a spatial circuit through user input from contact sensors extended in space and attached to surfaces it occupies. A replication system represents the flow of information, which is expressed via electrical impulses to a central core. Vine-like appendages radiating from the sculpture take on the function of sound sensitive ears to interactively communicate with the audience.<br><br>

The presentation is free to the public.<br><br>
