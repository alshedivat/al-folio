On July 21, 2010, 30 math and science high-school teachers from four midwestern states toured EVL as part of a two-week intensive University of Illinois Summer Training Institute (STI), a continuing education program offered by the <a href="http://www.pltw.illinois.edu">Illinois Project Lead The Way</a> initiative. The University of Illinois became a PLTW National Affiliate University in 2005, offering STI sessions on its Chicago and Urbana-Champaign campuses, sponsoring statewide PLTW conference and professional development activities, coordinating program implementation and recordkeeping, and maintaining the statewide Illinois PLTW program website.<br><br>

PLTW is the largest nonprofit provider of innovative and rigorous Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education programs - for students, parents, volunteers, school principals, and educators. PLTW encourages the development of problem-solving skills, critical thinking, creative and innovative reasoning, and a love of learning, with the ultimate goal of helping our next generation of leaders develop the critical-reasoning and problem-solving skills needed to help America to remain economically competitive.
Dr. Andy Johnson uses SAGE to give an EVL overview presentation to Illinois PLTW STI teachers in EVL&rsquo;s Cyber-Commons room.
