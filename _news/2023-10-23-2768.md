EVL alumni Tommy Marrinan, Victor Mateevitsi and Mike Papka (also EVL Professor) are recognized at <a href="https://sciviscontest2023.github.io/">2023 IEEE VIS SciVis Contest</a> for their research in the visualization of neuronal network simulations of plasticity changes in the human brain.<br><br>
The first award was for Best Workflow; enabling a scientific workflow was identified as one of the 4 main tasks for this year&rsquo;s contest. The goal of this component was to combine the functionality of the other tasks into a combined framework and interface that enables experts to explore the data and investigate several questions interactively.  Which tools help the users to mark, select, and analyze the data on different levels of complexity and transfer information among these levels?<br><br>
The second award was for 1st Place Overall; judges took into account how the submission addressed all 4 main tasks, as well as any additional features. The judging was based on a short paper description of the visualization system and an 8-minute video demo.<br><br>
Congratulations, Tommy, Victor, and Mike!<br><br>
