The annual &ldquo;SAGE3: Smart Amplified Group Environment for Harnessing the Data Revolution&rdquo; all hands meeting was held this year at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, in Oahu, Hawaii, June 26 - 30 2023.  UIC&rsquo; PI Andrew Johnson, CoPI Luc Renambot, and senior research staff member Lance Long attended the meeting with collaborators from Virginia Tech and the University of Hawaii to discuss the future of the project, achieved milestones, and current challenges.  These face-to-face meetings have proven critical to the advancement of the overall project objectives, as developers are able to exchange success stories and lessons learned from their collaborative work.  The intensive brainstorming has helped crystalize future directions and potential project expansion.<br><br>
Funded by NSF, SAGE3 puts the &ldquo;human in the loop&rdquo; by providing scientists with an intuitive framework that integrates state-of-the-art AI technologies with applications, workflows, smart visualizations and collaboration services to help them access, share, explore and analyze their data, come to conclusions, and make decisions with greater speed, accuracy, comprehension and confidence.  The project is scheduled to conclude in 2025.
