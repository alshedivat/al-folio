PhD student Ke Fan&rsquo;s research in profiling and visualizing performance data at scale is recognized with a best poster nomination at SC23. &ldquo;Two-phase IO Enabling Large-scale Performance Introspection&rdquo; focuses on developing an effective and interactive exploration of the profiles of large-scale parallel programs, which remain a challenge due to the high I/O overheads of profiles and the difficulties in scaling downstream visualization tools.<br><br>
The poster presents Viveka, a lightweight end-to-end system for profiling and visualizing the performance of MPI-based applications.<br>
- A simple data format for the generated logs that minimizes metadata, leading to a smaller storage footprint and faster load times. (on average 3x more lightweight than Caliper).<br>
- Development of a custom two-phase data aggregation system to scale parallel I/O (of performance data) to high core counts, ensuring minimal overhead.<br>
- A lightweight web-based visualization dashboard that is capable of performing interactive analysis of performance data collected at high process counts.<br>
- A case study on real parallel applications to demonstrate the efficacy of our profiling and visualization system.<br><br>
Funding in part by NSF RII Track-4 award 2132013, NSF PPoSS planning award 2217036, NSF PPoSS large award 2316157 and, NSF collaborative research award 2221811.  Compute hours provided on Theta Supercomputer Argonne Leadership Computing Facility&rsquo;s Directors Discretionary (DD) program.
