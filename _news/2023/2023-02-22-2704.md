&ldquo;Where the sidewalk ends&rdquo; in <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/open-source-tool-mapping-sidewalks-0315">MIT News</a> discusses how Miranda along with researchers from MIT, University of Sao Paulo, and New York University have built an open-source tool that uses aerial imagery and image-recognition to create complete maps of sidewalks and crosswalks. The tool, called TILE2NET can help planners, policymakers, and urbanists who want to expand pedestrian infrastructure.<br><br>
The research team used computerized image-recognition techniques to build a tool that will visually recognize sidewalks, crosswalks, and footpaths. To do that, the researchers first used 20,000 aerial images from Boston, Cambridge, New York City, and Washington - places where comprehensive pedestrian maps already existed. By training the image-recognition model on such clearly defined objects and using portions of those cities as a starting point, they were able to see how well TILE2NET would work elsewhere in those cities.<br><br>

Boston Commons: a) Aerial image, b) Detected sidewalk and footpath polygons (in orange) and detected crosswalks (in red), c) Fitted sidewalk, crosswalk, and footpath centerlines superimposed on the aerial image.
