## Multi-Organ Spatial Stratification of 3-D Dose Distributions Improves Risk Prediction of Long-Term Self-Reported Severe Symptoms in Oropharyngeal Cancer Patients Receiving Radiotherapy: Development of a Pre-Treatment Decision Support Tool


Overview of the methods used for each symptom of interest.

Advanced radiotherapy treatments for Oropharyngeal cancer have improved patient survival rates, although they lead to understudied long-term symptoms. By analyzing three-dimensional dose distributions to vital organs via custom unsupervised machine learning, we identify correlations with long-term patient-reported symptoms. Our innovative approach surpasses existing clinical guidelines, offering actionable insights for optimizing treatment plans and minimizing post-treatment side effects.<br><br>
