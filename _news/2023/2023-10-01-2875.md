## NAIRR Pilot: A National-Scale Testbed Supporting Artificial Intelligence Research Spanning the Computing Continuum



![image](/images/sage_image-1024x576.jpeg-srcw.jpg){:style="max-width: 100%"}

We will evolve the national-scale Sage platform to build a new pathfinding testbed that links real-time AI-enabled sensors with existing NSF HPC and networking resources to provide unique cyber-infrastructure supporting research exploring new AI techniques, algorithms, and AI-driven climate understanding. The future national-scale computing continuum can use the testbed to gain critical insights and advance AI, as well as the coupled complex adaptive systems that makeup Earth&rsquo;s biosphere.<br><br>
The UIC team, led by Michael E. Papka, will collaboratively work with Northwestern University and other participating institutions to lead the following:<br>
i. Low-Cost Sage Node Development: UIC will oversee a team of undergraduate students who will research and develop low-cost Sage nodes for use in classroom settings. These nodes will be designed to provide accessible and affordable access to the Sage platform for educational purposes. Deliverables include designing and developing low-cost Sage nodes, documentation, and evaluating their performance and usability in classroom settings.<br><br>
ii. Jupyter Notebook Examples for Education and Outreach: The UIC team will lead the development of educational examples using Jupyter notebooks to support the project&rsquo;s education and outreach objectives. These examples will demonstrate the capabilities of the Sage platform and provide accessible learning resources for students and educators interested in AI techniques, algorithms, and AI-driven climate understanding. Deliverables include the creation of Jupyter notebook examples, user guides, and instructional materials to support their use in educational settings, as well as reports detailing the impact and effectiveness of these resources in achieving the project&rsquo;s education and outreach objectives.
