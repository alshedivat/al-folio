EVL professor Mike Papka and his research students have been awarded an Honorable Mention in the EuroVis Best Paper Category for &ldquo;ChemoGraph: Interactive Visual Exploration of the Chemical Space&rdquo;.  Co-authored by collaborators Bharat Kale, Austin Clyde, Maoyuan Sun, Arvind Ramanathan, Rick Stevens, and Michael E. Papka, ChemoGraph is a novel visual analytics technique for interactively exploring related chemicals. A chemical space is formalized as a hypergraph with novel machine-learning models to compute related chemical compounds applied. It uses a database to find related compounds from an available space and a machine learning model to generate new ones, which helps enlarge the known space.  Moreover, ChemoGraph highlights interactive features that support users in viewing, comparing, and organizing computationally identified related chemicals.<br><br>
