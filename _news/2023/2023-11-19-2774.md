Rayleigh-Benard (RB) convection occurs in a fluid layer when there is a temperature difference between the top and bottom boundaries, resulting in the spontaneous formation of convective motion.  In this study, a direct numerical simulation has been performed aimed at elucidating the impact of introducing dispersed droplets into a single-phase flow on the heat transfer dynamics within this flow.  The dimensionless parameters considered in this study encompass a Prandtl number of 4, a Weber number of 6000, and a Rayleigh number of 10^8.  Dispersed droplets were incorporated over a range spanning from 0 to 50%.
