EVL&rsquo;s professor Marai is part of UIC&rsquo;s brain research now funded by a $5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health.  The project incorporates brain tissue research at UIC, Northwestern University, Lurie Children’s Hospital, Rush University, and the University of Chicago, utilizing the INTUITION data platform that combines tissue data with clinical, functional, genetic, and 3D imaging information.  The goal of the project is to assist clinicians in treating patients and help researchers better understand the mechanisms of brain disorders by developing a new resource for clinical care and research on epilepsy, brain tumors, and neurological disorders.<br><br>
The project is led by Dr. Jeffrey Loeb, the John S. Garvin Endowed Chair in Neurology at UIC, professor, and head of neurology and rehabilitation in the College of Medicine.  INTUITION was initially supported by funding from the Discovery Partners Institute to create I-BRAIN, an initiative exploring commercialization opportunities around brain tissue data and research.  Other UIC researchers include Dr. Anna Serafini, Biswajit Maharathi, Fozia Mir and Dr. Ahmad Daher from the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation; Dr. Francesco Pucci from the Department of Neurosurgery; and Dr. Tibor Valyi-Nagy from the Department of Pathology.<br><br>
