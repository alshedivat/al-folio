EVL hosts Jorge Wagner as a guest speaker, presenting &ldquo;Designing and Evaluating HMD-Based Immersive Analytics Environments&rdquo;.<br><br>
Friday 10/18/24, 1pm<br>
EVL Continuum, Room 2068  (Engineering Research Facility)<br><br>
<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The potential of Immersive Analytics approaches to enhance how humans understand and interact with data has attracted the attention of visualization researchers for decades, as is well illustrated by the work done at the EVL. Quick technological advances in head-mounted displays over the last years led to devices such as Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro, bringing those techniques closer to widespread adoption. However, the design space for Immersive Analytics applications is vast, and it is crucial to understand the advantages and disadvantages of alternative designs. Over the last eight years, during the development of my Master&rsquo;s and PhD dissertations, I have studied the design of HMD-based environments for Immersive Analytics, investigating different data exploration metaphors, frames of reference, and modes of interaction. As a result, I have also proposed a series of ideas to reimagine existing visualization applications to take advantage of the benefits of immersion. In this talk, I will present an overview of my research work and my current ideas on this topic, with a deeper focus on my most recent paper, &ldquo;Reimagining TaxiVis,&rdquo; which I believe sets forth concepts that can be useful for other applications.<br><br>
<strong>Bio</strong><br>
PhD student in Computer Science at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil, researching guidelines for efficient 3D data exploration with Immersive Analytics under the supervision of Prof. Luciana Nedel and Prof. Wolfgang Stuerzlinger. Jorge was a 2021-2022 Microsoft Research PhD Fellow and a Research Intern in Apple&rsquo;s Vision Products Group from April to October 2024. Recently, he was also a Fulbright Visiting Student Researcher at New York University, working under the supervision of Prof. Claudio Silva (2021-2022). Before that, he completed a six-month research internship with Prof. Stuerzlinger at Simon Fraser University, Canada, as part of the Emerging Leaders in the Americas program (2019).
