## Tele-robotics to Tele-autonomous Robotics for Isotope Production



![image](/images/anl_tele-robotics.png-srcw.jpg){:style="max-width: 100%"}

EVL graduate research assistants are working with Argonne National Laboratory scientists on the project entitled &ldquo;Tele-autonomous Dexterous Robotics&rdquo;, contributing expertise in (i) building digital models of the key components (robot arms, manipulator, some processing equipment) and optimization of models for real-time, high spacial resolution interaction; (ii) explore Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR and AR) technologies/methodologies/architectures; and (iii) design an immersive display with high spatial resolution and low latency.<br><br>
The tasks include:<br>
* Explore Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR and AR) technologies/methodologies/architectures.<br>
* Build and optimize an immersive display for real-time, low latency, high spatial resolution tele-autonomous control of the remote processes.<br>
