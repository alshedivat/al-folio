The George Crabtree Institute for Discovery and Sustainability is an institutional partnership between Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), enabling transformative solutions for complex scientific challenges. This collaboration aims to advance knowledge in science and technology, propel sustainable innovation, promote diversity in perspectives, and be supportive of the next generation of researchers.<br><br>
EVL and Computer Science professor Michael E. Papka and Jordi Cabana will lead the institute as its founding co-directors, actively engaging with Argonne and UIC in their current leadership roles. Their co-director roles will bring forward collaboration opportunities, coordinate within and across both institutions and support future scientists and interdisciplinary, inclusive research.<br><br>
Some of the institute&rsquo;s initial programming includes faculty engagement via the Argonne Collaborative Research Fellowship Program, which is supported through strategic use of the Joint Appointment Program, recruitment of undergraduate and graduate students, and scientific workshops.
