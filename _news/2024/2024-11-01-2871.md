<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
When interacting with large displays, virtual reality, or augmented reality, people often use mid-air gestures. During these touchless interactions, they may need to alternate between hands or use both hands simultaneously. Most individuals have a hand preference, and preferred and non-preferred hands in lateralized individuals perform differently due to cerebral hemispheric specialization. For example, in right-handed individuals, the right hand is typically better at sequential motor tasks - those requiring (sensory) feedback control - whereas the left hand is better at parallel processing or open-loop behavior. In this thesis, we examine how lateral asymmetry impacts user performance in touchless input. My research provides an empirical investigation to characterize touchless performance when using preferred, non-preferred, and both hands. It explores binding the related tasks sequentially and in parallel, as well as different phrase structures, considering how much muscular tension is involved.<br><br>
In this work, we compared preferred and non-preferred hand performance in simple and compound tasks, such as pointing and select-and-dragging, respectively. In right-handed individuals, we did not find any significant performance differences between their preferred and non-preferred hands in touchless pointing or dragging. However, between-hand performance differences were significant when using mouse and stylus input.<br><br>
Additionally, we studied how phrasing with both hands can support volumetric multi-selection in touchless input. We present an empirical comparison of mid-air multi-selection techniques spanning dominant and non-dominant hand actions. The symmetric-synchronous and high-tension asymmetric-asynchronous bimanual techniques were not significantly different in terms of efficiency, and accuracy for within-reach targets. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between low and high-tension asymmetric-asynchronous bimanual techniques. The symmetric-synchronous bimanual technique was most preferred by users.<br><br>
Lastly, we explored how different phrase structures in bimanual phrasing impact compound task performance, such as touchless multi-selection and manipulation (e.g., drag-and-drop). Our findings revealed that while accuracy remained consistent across different tension levels, higher tension led to faster completion times through continuous gesture engagement. Interestingly, participants preferred half-tension phrasing for its ergonomic balance, as it minimized fatigue without compromising efficiency. These empirical findings can inform the design of future bimanual and multimodal interaction techniques involving touchless input.
