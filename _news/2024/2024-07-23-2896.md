SAGE3 (the Smart Amplified Group Environment) is an open-source collaboration software platform designed for real-time interactive information and visualization sharing. Seamlessly complementing video conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meets, it enhances group environments for information-rich collaboration. With SAGE3, users can collaborate on their laptops, meeting room projectors, and on large tiled display walls. SAGE3 on large display spaces has proven to enable people to think, brainstorm, discover and reach decisions with greater speed, accuracy, comprehensiveness and confidence. SAGE3 provides a large collaborative canvas for sharing and editing of media, data, code, visualizations, dashboards, and screen-shares. SAGE3 is ideally suiting for collaborative data science, project meetings, and classroom education scenarios.  <a href="https://sage3.sagecommons.org/">https://sage3.sagecommons.org/</a>
