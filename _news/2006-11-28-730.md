StarFlight, an interactive virtual reality application that explores the three-dimensional nature of constellations, opens in Mexico City&rsquo;s Laboratorio Arte Alameda on November 28 and runs through February 11, 2007. The exhibit was developed by the University of Chicago&rsquo;s Center for the Presentation of Science in collaboration with the Electronic Visualization Laboratory, with funding provided by the National Science Foundation.<br><br>

StarFlight provides an interactive exploration of the Orion, Ursa Major and Scorpius constellations from Earth and from space using star data cataloged by the European Space Agency&rsquo;s Hipparcos Satellite. It is being exhibited in Mexico City as part of a cooperative educational outreach agreement between the University of Chicago and the <em>Laboratorio Arte Alameda</em>.
