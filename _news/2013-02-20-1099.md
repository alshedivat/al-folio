EVL associate professor, Daria Tsoupikova presents her collaborative research at the 2013 NextMed NMVR20 Conference in San Diego, CA. Tsoupikova&rsquo;s presentation describes a Virtual Reality (VR) system designed for hand rehabilitation therapy following stroke. The system, developed by an interdisciplinary team of engineers, art therapists, occupational therapists, and VR artist was designed to improve patient&rsquo;s motivation and engagement during post stroke rehabilitation. The presentation describes system design, development, and user testing for efficiency, subject&rsquo;s satisfaction and clinical feasibility. Initial results are outlined. Early user study results demonstrate the system is operational and can facilitate therapy for post stroke patients with upper extremity impairment.<br><br>

The &ldquo;Medicine Meets Virtual Reality&rdquo; conference, NextMed / MMVR has served as a forum for researchers harnessing IT advances for the benefit of patient diagnosis and care, medical education, and procedural training since 1992. Over the years, its curriculum expanded well beyond virtual reality. The conference now presents a wide spectrum of innovation and examines emerging technologies - and envision future directions for the field.
