MS candidate and Italian exchange student, Andrea Purgato presents his research into methods for the GPU-based computation to define the structure of a dynamic social or biological network.  Emphasis is placed expressly on brain network computation, which is computationally expensive.  The goal is to speed up the computation process by using high performance computing techniques, exploiting the computational power and the architecture of GPU.  Examples centered on a real-time visualization of the computed networks, using GPU-accelerated computing will be presented.  The goal is to provide researchers' greater insight into the structures of dynamic networks.
