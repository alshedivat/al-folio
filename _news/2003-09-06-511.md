The collaborative virtual artwork <em>CityiCluster</em> &ldquo;From the Renaissance to the Gigabits Networking Age&rdquo; by Franz Fischnaller, will be exhibit at Ars Electronica Festival 2003, CODE - the Language of Our Time, AEC Museum of the Future, Linz, Austria, September 6 -11 2003.<br><br>

<em>&ldquo;CODE - the Language of our Time&rdquo; is the theme of Ars Electronica 2003, an encounter with digital codes role within and influence upon art and society. Three thematic domains-Code=Law, Code=Art, Code=Life - provide 
a framework for this artistic, political and scientific confrontation with core issues.</em><br>
- Dr. Christine Schoepf and Gerfried Stocker<br><br>

<em>CityCluster</em> is a virtual-reality networking matrix - a creative, high-tech container with original technological features, navigation, interactivity and graphical content. Multiple environments (or cities - both real and imagined) coexist through a common virtual territory, interconnected via high-speed networking, which enable remote participants to interact and collaborate in the shared &lsquo;city&rsquo; spaces of Florence and Chicago.
