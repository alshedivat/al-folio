<em>Ahmed Kassem, director of the UIC Academic Computing and Communications Center, vice provost for information technology and chief information officer, retires May 1 after more than 30 years at University of Illinois. Over the years, Ahmed has worked diligently to provide UIC with outstanding computing and networking facilities and services, as an article in this week&rsquo;s UIC NEWS describes. In addition to focusing on the breadth of Information Technology capabilities available to UIC faculty, staff and students, he has focused on the depth, enabling several campus laboratories and centers involved in high-performance computing and networking activities to attract major Federal funding and to achieve national and international recognition for their research. EVL is one such campus laboratory, and we will surely miss Ahmed&rsquo;s steadfast support and encouragement.</em><br><br>

Kassem, who retires May 1, will long be remembered for his work guiding the campus through the rise of the Internet while making computing services more accessible, Brown said.<br><br>
