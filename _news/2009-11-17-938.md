Want to create &ldquo;cyber-mashups&rdquo; and easily juxtapose information on tiled display walls? SAGE is the answer. SAGE provides a common environment to access, stream and view data objects on tiled display walls of any size - whether digital cinema animations, high-resolution images, high-definition video-teleconferencing, presentation slides, documents, spreadsheets or laptop screens.<br><br>

NSF believes this important, and recently awarded University of Illinois at Chicago&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) a 3-year grant to transition SAGE from a research prototype to a hardened technology for cyberinfrastructure. EVL&rsquo;s goal is to develop production-quality, community-driven, open services for visualization and collaboration, foster the growth of the burgeoning SAGE user community, and create a forum for developers and users to contribute new tools, capabilities and applications.<br><br>

<strong>SAGE BOF</strong><br>
EVL will host a SAGE Birds of a Feather (BOF) session at SC09<br><br>

Tuesday,  November 17<br>
12:15PM - 01:15PM<br>
Oregon Convention Center, Portland, Room A107-108<br><br>

<strong>SAGE DEMOS</strong><br>
Members of the SAGE User Community are showcasing several SAGE applications in their research booths at SC09. As of today, we are aware of the following demos:<br><br>

DUTCH RESEARCH CONSORTIUM (BOOTH #2154)<br>
The SARA Computing and Networking Services facility of The Netherlands plans several SAGE demonstrations:<br>
<ul>
<li>Video streaming from Amsterdam to Portland, in cooperation with the University of Amsterdam, of 4K, 2K and 1K video material</li>
<li>A parameter study of a global climate simulation, project Essence, showing 36 different variables simultaneously</li>
<li>CosmoGrid, a large-scale cosmological dark-matter simulation, displaying 8128x5248 pre-generated content, while comparing to lower resolutions to show added value</li>
<li>FlySafe, a project that tracks and predicts bird migration patterns to aid flight safety</li>
<li>Pinnacle, a project simulating flow dynamics in warming air layers</li>
</ul><br>

TACC, UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND AND DELL (BOOTH #1545 AND #1535)<br>
The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) is deploying an NSF-funded ultra-scale visualization cluster &ldquo;Longhorn&rdquo; at its facility in Austin, Texas, and uses SAGE to demonstrate Longhorn&rsquo;s large-scale remote visualization and collaboration capabilities. Using SAGE and the TeraGrid&rsquo;s 10Gbps network, large-scale visualizations coming off Longhorn are displayed on a 36-Megapixel tiled display wall in the TACC booth on the show floor. In addition, the University of Queensland in Australia streams uncompressed and DXT-compressed full-HD live camera feeds and visualization streams to the TACC booth using SAGE over AARNet, Pacific Wave, and NLR PacketNet. These streams are also forwarded to the Dell booth on the show floor.<br><br>

OSAKA UNIVERSITY (BOOTH #907)<br>
Osaka University of Japan plans two demonstrations:<br>
<ul>
<li>Uncompressed HDTV on a tiled display wall: Osaka University and NTT use NTT&rsquo;s i-Visto uncompressed HDTV player and SAGE to stream video in real time to a tiled display wall in Osaka&rsquo;s booth on the show floor</li>
<li>Application Control Module for SAGE: Users view and compare multiple drug docking simulation results on a tiled display wall in Osaka University&rsquo;s booth that are calculated on distributed computational grid resources in Japan and the US. Osaka&rsquo;s Application Control Module enables users to manipulate the applications themselves as well as manage their windows using a SAGE UI.</li>
</ul><br>

<strong>About <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=1&amp;indi=281">SAGE</a></strong><br>
SAGE, the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment, is cross-platform, open-source middleware that enables users worldwide to have a common operating environment, or framework, to access, stream and juxtapose data objects - whether digital cinema animations, high-resolution images, high-definition video-teleconferencing, presentation slides, documents, spreadsheets or laptop screens - on one or more tiled display walls. SAGE is an outgrowth of the NSF-funded OptIPuter project, whose goal was to enable collaborating scientists to interactively explore massive amounts of previously uncorrelated data by developing new architectures for shared e-science facilities. Early adaptors are creating a nascent international user community that is referred to as the OptIPlanet Collaboratory. NSF recently awarded a three-year, $1.9-Million grant to the University of Illinois at Chicago&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) to create persistent SAGE visualization and collaboration services for global cyberinfrastructure.
