<a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/franz/index.html">Franz Fischnaller</a>, artist and professor at the University of Illinois, Electronic Visualization Laboratory will present the first spring colloquium in Art and Technology at Northwestern University Friday, March 30 at 3 pm in Louis Hall, Rm. 119.<br><br>

Fischnaller will discuss his work in virtual environments, including: Robot Avatars and Virtual Illusion, Multi Mega Book, Kali the Goddess of the Millenium, Pinocchio Interactive, and Tracking the Net.<br><br>

<em>&ldquo;Digital media are influencing the arts and shaping culture by giving form to new artistic languages, revolutionizing the composition and treatment of the image, the concept of &lsquo;perspective&rsquo;, and the perception of space,&rdquo;</em> said Fischnaller. <em>&ldquo;The digital artist&rsquo;s creative and production processes are undergoing radical changes as well. Dematerialization and fragmentation of the tangible coexist with the increasing ability to experience the intangible. The invisible is taking form.&rdquo;</em>
Tracking the Net
