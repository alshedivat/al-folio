&ldquo;A Small Comfort&rdquo; is a story of life, death, transformation and regeneration. An imprisoned woman gazes through the window of her cell at a surreal landscape filled with gently undulating life forms. She dreams of freedom, but even more so, for a companion to ease her solitude. Through a mysterious process she is transformed into a cat and her freedom is granted. However, while free she commits an act of violence against one of the environment&rsquo;s inhabitants. Her freedom is taken from her again, but she does get her companion, the &ldquo;small comfort&rdquo;.
