<em>Orgworld</em>is a virtual reality experience that is exhibited on EVL&rsquo;s ImmersaDesk&trade;. <em>Orgworld</em> brings static objects to life, in the process making them living creatures by giving them motion, behavior, and distinct personalities. They live in environments that reflect their nature.<br><br>

Virtual Reality is an appropriate medium for this, due to its qualities of immersiveness and interactivity. The user is actually placed within the world of the creatures, rather than passively observing them. While in this world, their actions affect the behavior of the creatures, and the creatures influence what the user does.<br><br>

<em>Orgworld</em> was showcased at SIGGRAPH 96 in The Bridge Art Show.
