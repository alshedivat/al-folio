This project was created for the Smithsonian&rsquo;s Ocean Planet exhibition. It&rsquo;s a 2 minute animation of a flyby of the Pacific Ocean. The animation begins in outer space, zooms in to the Earth near Hawaii, dives underwater and races across the floor of the Pacific, travels down the Marianas trench, then re-emerges and returns to space.
