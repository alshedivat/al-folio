One of the major problems in three-dimensional field computation is visualizing the resulting 3-D field distributions. A virtual reality environment, such as the CAVE is helping to overcome this problem, thus making the results of computation more usable for designers and users of magnets and other electromagnetic devices. As a demonstration of the capabilities of the CAVE, the Elliptical Multiplole Wiggler (EMW), an insertion device being disigned for the Advanced Photon Source (APS) now being commissioned at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) was made visible, along with its fields and beam orbits. Other use of the CAVE in preprocessing and postprocessing computation for electromagnetic applications is underway.
