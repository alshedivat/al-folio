&ldquo;Waterlogged&rdquo; deals with struggle. The viewer is confronted with a large-scale rendition of individuals struggling to breath and break free of their liquid confines. The piece explores not only the obvious external struggles of the individuals portrayed, but also reflects the inner struggles that each of them, and us, ultimately deals with in one way or another.<br><br>

&ldquo;Waterlogged&rdquo; was displayed as a video installation at the Gallery 400, Chicago as part of Insley&rsquo;s MFA Thesis exhibition. The installation consisted of a single video projection onto the floor, which required the viewer to look down upon the imagery, emulating the circumstances under which the footage was originally taken.
