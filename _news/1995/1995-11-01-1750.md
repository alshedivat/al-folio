&ldquo;Lucifer Lounge&rdquo; to a large extent deals with struggles, both internal and external. In some ways the viewers / participants, primarily through interaction with live remote actors and at some level through their experience within the graphics, are made to reflect upon their lives up to this point. For me, the most important aspect of the piece is the interaction. I don&rsquo;t want the viewers to take a passive role, rather to be an active part of the overall experience. I chose virtual reality as the primary medium for this piece because it inherently involves the user. I also chose to incorporate the use of live performers to enhance the piece because they can bring the interaction to a greater level which would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve with the graphics alone.<br><br>

In &ldquo;Lucifer Lounge&rdquo; the users will find themselves in a labyrinth, where they encounter the prince of darkness, who is watching them via closed circuit television. He appears to them on video monitors on either side of the ImmersaDesk (IDesk) virtual reality system. The labyrinth, within the graphics of the IDesk, consists of numerous rooms connected by various walkways. There are four central rooms within the main structure (which form an octagon). Behind each of these main walls lie two octagonal rooms, one above the other. In each of these outer rooms there is a door at the outside wall. As the participants travel through the labyrinth, their mission is to discover how to get these doors open, and to find the one that leads to Lucifer&rsquo;s lounge. Should they find the right path, a guide will come to escort them to the remote physical space where Lucifer himself is entertaining those fortunate enough to be invited.
