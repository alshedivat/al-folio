<em>Fluid Infinity</em> is a virtual reality artwork prototyped as a multi-layered abstract, 2D animation. The animation was initially programmed using the RT/1 graphics language developed at EVL and then subsequently converted to C, IrisGL and CAVE code.<br><br>

The infinitely evolving 2D space of the original animation was transformed and adapted in three dimensions, by adding depth and enclosing the animation within a boxed room. In its virtual form, the animation became a sculptural element, where 2D and 3D designs were created by participant body position and perspective within the real and/or virtual space.
