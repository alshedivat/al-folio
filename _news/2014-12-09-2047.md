These days vast amounts of information are continuously being created. By analyzing these data, we could help solve current issues that we are faced with, and we might have a better ability to predict the future. Large high-resolution displays can support increasing the amount of data being displayed. Therefore, large high-resolution environments have the potential to provide affordable infrastructure to maximize insight for exploration and analytic work of large and complex data. Unfortunately the current usage of large high-resolution environment has been limited to presentation, demonstration, or user studies due to usability issues on large high-resolution displays. User behavior analysis researchers have found that it became more difficult and time consuming to access and manipulate information as screen size increased, users were easily frustrated and confused when they changed environments, users wasted more space on large high-resolution displays, and users felt guilty about the wasted space. These usability issues can hinder the user from concentrating on their task and data. This is the serious issue in moving beyond the current usage of large high-resolution display environments. As display size increases, the degree of these usability issues will also increase.<br><br>
 
This dissertation focuses on space organization design to solve usability issues. Space organization design can impact how users can effectively make use of large high-resolution display. First, we observed user behaviors in different use cases on large high-resolution displays. We introduced design principles driven from these observations. We proposed space organization design. It consists of space organization policies, new enhanced techniques, and multi-touch interaction. To evaluate the proposed design we conducted a comparative user study in data exploration and analytic workspace, and a case study in small group meeting space. The proposed design significantly impacts the userâ€™s analytic activity and usage of the space. Information manipulation time was significantly reduced, so participants could focus more on their task and data. Activity transitions were subtly changed to improve transition flow, which included less space layout activity. Used space ratio was significantly increased, the distribution used space was significantly fair, and focal area of usage was slightly wider.
