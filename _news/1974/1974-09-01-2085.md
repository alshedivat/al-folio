In 1974, EVL&rsquo;s co-directors Tom DeFanti and Dan Sandin used the GRASS programming language and the Sandin Image Processor to create the special effects for movie director Michael A. DeGaetano&rsquo;s independent film &ldquo;UFO: Target Earth&rdquo;.<br><br>
The film features an electronics expert searching for evidence of aliens picks up signals that he believes are from an alien spacecraft--and they are coming from a lake near town.
