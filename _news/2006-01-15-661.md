EVL Assistant Professor (UIC School of Art &amp; Design), Daria Tsoupikova presents her virtual reality artwork at SPIE 2006 - The Engineering Reality of Virtual Reality.  &ldquo;Rutopia2&rdquo; is developed for interaction and display on the CAVE / CWall networked advanced visualization environments.<br><br>

&ldquo;Rutopia2&rdquo; describes a magic garden with interactive sculptural trees that branch to distant worlds; participants traverse the branches into a shared networked community. &ldquo;Rutopia2&rdquo; explores the aesthetics of virtual art in its relationship with the art of painting and Russian folk arts.
