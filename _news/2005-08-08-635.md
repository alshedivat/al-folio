Researchers from the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), collaborated with researchers at the California Institute for Telecommunictions and Information Technology (<a href="http://www.calit2.net">Calit2</a>) at UCSD and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (<a href="http://cisto.gsfc.nasa.gov/IRAD_Lambda.html">GSFC</a>), using Optiputer on a new 10-Gigabit per second (Gbps) National LambdaRail, linking NASA research center to UCSD. During the Live Demonstration of 21st Century National-Scale Team Science, scientists were allowed to establish high-definition telepresence, while also collaborating in real time on visualizing massive amounts of remote land and weather data. The software framework driving the large tiled display at GFSC - the HyperWall, was the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment (<a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=1&amp;indi=281">SAGE</a>), developed at EVL. <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=1&amp;indi=222">Teravision</a> and <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=1&amp;indi=242">Juxtaview</a>, two other applications developed at EVL, were also operated using SAGE.
