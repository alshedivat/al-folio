EVL demonstrates Project LifeLike at the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s (NSF) annual Industry &amp; University Cooperative Research (I/UCRC) meeting in Arlington, Virginia. A realistic avatar representation of NSF Program Manager Alexander Schwarzkopf - the founder of I/UCRC was created for the demonstration.  Meeting attendees were able to communicate with the Virtual Alex verbally and receive information about the I/UCRC program spoken back by the avatar. The long term goal of Project LifeLike is to develop intelligent responsive avatars as future interfaces to computers as well as digital archival technologies for humans that captures both their lifelike expressions and their knowledge. Project LifeLike is supported by a 3-year grant from NSF.
