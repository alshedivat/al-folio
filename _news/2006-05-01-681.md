<strong>UIC College of Engineering News</strong><br><br>

Professor Tom Moher has been named a UIC Great Cities Scholar for the academic year 2006-2007. Moher, the first faculty member from the College of Engineering to receive the award since its inception in 1999, received the award for his proposal, &ldquo;Technology Support for Embodied Learning in Urban Science Classrooms,&rdquo; which seeks to investigate the potential of ubiquitous, ambient media in supporting science inquiry in elementary and middle schools.<br><br>

The Great Cities Institute (GCI) serves as the University of Illinois at Chicago&rsquo;s focal point for new initiatives in interdisciplinary, applied urban research, summarized in UIC&rsquo;s metropolitan commitment known as the Great Cities Commitment. GCI attempts to build a unique, responsive and strongly supported center of urban research based on UIC&rsquo;s commitment to first class research in and for the great cities of the world - with a particular emphasis on Chicago.<br><br>

Institute Scholars pursue their research and participate in the development of the Institute, which is devoted to research surrounding issues of importance to cities.  They are released from formal teaching and administrative obligations during their apointment at the Institute.
