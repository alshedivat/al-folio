EVL is participating in the Sixth Annual UIC Daughters at Work Day organized by The Office of Women&rsquo;s Affairs, Thursday, April 23. Sixteen girls will come to see applications in the CAVE and talk about careers in Electronic Visualization in both art and science.<br><br>

This event was inspired by the national &ldquo;Take Our Daughters to Work Day&rdquo; founded by the Ms. Foundation to help combat the dramatic decrease in career aspirations and self esteem that happens in girls ages 9 to 15.<br><br>

This event is endorsed by the Office of the Chancellor and its co-sponsors, Chancellor&rsquo;s Committee on the Status of Women, and Facilities Management.
