Audio Dilation is a technique that slows down the tempo of audio signals without changing the pitch or otherwise distorting the sounds. Networked On-line Audio Dilation is an Android application that allows users to dilate audio while engaged in a full-duplex networked conversation. The capability can potentially be used to improve comprehension for hearing or cognitively impaired individuals, or for non-native speakers of foreign languages.<br><br>
