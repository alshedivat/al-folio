This year, UIC Computer Science PhD student and Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) research assistant Arthur Nishimoto received an Honorable Mention in the campus&rsquo; 2014 Image of Research competition. Nishimoto&rsquo;s work, &ldquo;Getting in Touch with the Data,&rdquo; explores a user interface design that enables users to easily access a menu anywhere on a tiled display wall and open a thumbnail browser in order to select files for display.<br><br>

Winning entries are to be displayed in the lobby of the Daley Library from November 6 through Jan. 31. After the Daley Library exhibit, winning entries will be displayed at the Library of Health Sciences and on banners around campus.<br>

It should be noted that when the judges reviewed all the Image of Research submissions this past summer, they used EVL&rsquo;s largest tiled display system, the CAVE2 hybrid reality environment, to display all the entries at once in high resolution for easy comparison and grouping.<br><br>
