Dan Sandin, co-founder and director emeritus of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is one of the artists showing his virtual-reality piece, &ldquo;Particle Dreams in Spherical Harmonics,&rdquo; as part of the 4-day Filmatic Festival at UC San Diego, from April 24-27, 2014. The Particle Dreams virtual-reality installation is the latest of a series of VR art installations created by Dan Sandin and collaborators to involve the viewer-participant in the creation of an immersive, visual, and sonic experience. It is based on the physical simulation of over one million particles with momentum and elastic reflection in an environment with gravity. In the final scene there is a very realistic rendering of water with reflections, and lighting based on spherical harmonics. The sound components are triggered and modified by the user and particle interaction. Sandin developed this interactive art piece in collaboration with Robert Kooima, Laurie Spiegel, Andrew Prudhomme, and Tom DeFanti.<br><br>
 
Organized by UC San Diego&rsquo;s ArtPower! in conjunction with Qualcomm Institute, the UC San Diego division of Calit2, the Filmatic Festival celebrates the creative media work of UCSD faculty, students and International artists, and is open to the general public. Experiences include interactive performances and screenings, gaming, media installations, 3D experiences, workshops, crowd-sourced material, digital industry ArtTalks!, parties, and more.
