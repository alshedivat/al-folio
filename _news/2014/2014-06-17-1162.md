The Electronic Visualization Lab (EVL) at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) is pleased to present two new artworks made for the CAVE2&trade; and Cyber-Commons tiled display system. The projects were produced through a unique collaboration between EVL faculty and staff, and visiting artists from Philadelphia and Norway.<br><br>

<em>Hearts and Minds: The Interrogations Project</em> is a 3D narrative experience made for the affective sensory environment of the EVL&rsquo;s CAVE2 that gives voice to stories of violence and the post-traumatic stress experienced by ordinary American soldiers who became torturers in the course of serving their country. During the American-led counterinsurgency and counterterrorism campaigns in Iraq in the years after September 11, 2001, the torture and abuse of detainees was a commonplace tactic. <em>Hearts and Minds: the Interrogations Project</em> is based on interviews of American soldiers conducted by Dr. John Tsukayama. Viewers travel through the domestic spaces and surreal interior landscapes of soldiers who have come home transformed by these experiences, triggering their testimonies by interacting with objects laden with loss.<br><br>

<em>Hearts and Minds</em> is developed by a team including filmmaker Roderick Coover, writer Scott Rettberg, artist and visualization researcher Daria Tsoupikova, computer scientist Arthur Nishimoto,  sound designer Mark Partridge, production assistant Mark Baratta, and senior research programmer Lance Long. Dr. Jeffrey Stevenson Murer of St. Andrews University, Scotland also contributed as a consultant on the project. EVL, the UIC Department of Art and Design, Temple University, and the Norwegian Research Council supported the development of the project.<br><br>

<em>Toxi*City</em> is a combinatory climate change narrative that generates a new feature-length film each time it is shown. Seven people struggle to survive after hurricanes and toxic events have devastated Philadelphia and New Jersey. These speculative stories of life in a post-industrial wasteland are set against the true stories of deaths from Hurricane Sandy in an algorithmic symphony of contemporary despair. <em>Toxi*City</em> was produced by Roderick Coover, Scott Rettberg, and collaborators, and supported by Temple University, the Chemical Heritage Foundation Museum, and the Norwegian Research Council. A preview of Toxi*City is available online: <a href="http://vimeo.com/67936189">vimeo.com/67936189</a><br><br>
These events have been organized by the EVL, Department of Art and Design, and the Electronic Literature Organization.<br><br>

Both events are free and open to the public. Each of the two projects takes about 50 minutes to experience fully. Because space in the CAVE2 is limited, reservations are required and we will only be able to accommodate 40 visitors per showing.<br><br>
