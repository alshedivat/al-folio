EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: UIC received a $3 million award from the National Science Foundation entitled &ldquo;Development of the Sensor Environment Imaging (SENSEI) Instrument,&rdquo; for the period October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2017, to build the SENSEI (SENSor Environment Imaging) instrument that will capture still and motion, 3D full-sphere omnidirectional stereoscopic video and images of real-world scenes, to be viewed in collaboration-enabled, nationally networked, 3D virtual-reality systems.<br><br>

The principal investigator (PI) is Maxine Brown, Director of the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), with co-PIs  Robert V. Kenyon, Andrew E. Johnson and Tanya Berger-Wolf, who are UIC Computer Science professors. Johnson is also the EVL Director of Research.<br><br>

Four other institutions are receiving subawards and are contributing on the project: UC San Diego (subaward lead Truong Nguyen), University of Hawai&#8216;i at M&#257;noa (subaward lead Jason Leigh), Scripps Institution of Oceanography (subaward lead Jules Jaffe) and Jackson State University (subaward lead Francois Modave).<br><br>

The UIC Computer Science Department announced the award in the article <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/Main/NewsItem?audience=public&amp;ind=622">&ldquo;Electronic Visualization Lab of UIC Computer Science Department receives new $3 million grant from NSF&rdquo;</a> on its website on September 17, 2014.
The SENSEI instrument will capture images in 360 degrees; the goal is to arrange 50 pairs of current 1/4&rdquo; HDTV 5-Mpixel 1080p sensors (shown below) as well as cabling, inside a circular outer structure
