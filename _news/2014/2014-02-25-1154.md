UI LABS, an initiative begun more than two years ago by the University of Illinois drawing on the expertise on its three campuses, has been awarded a $70 million grant from the Department of Defense to create a research center for digital-manufacturing technology.<br><br>

UIC&rsquo;s role in the proposal focused on its strengths in computer visualization and technical workforce development.<br><br>

President Obama announced the investment as part of his vision to re-invigorate U.S. manufacturing, by creating new jobs, encouraging economic development, and spurring future innovation.<br><br>

The Digital Lab will apply cutting-edge mobile, cloud, and high-performance computing technologies to manufacturing challenges - and reduce costs through greater use of technology, from robotics to visualization.<br><br>

UIC&rsquo;s strength in computer visualization, as well as its role in creating and continued involvement with &ldquo;StarLight&rdquo;, an international research &amp; education communications exchange facility for high-performance networks, is a critical asset for the UIUC / NCSA Blue Waters Peta-scale computing facility to achieve the needed speed links and capacity in the &ldquo;digital commons&rdquo; for the digital manufacturing, said Mitra Dutta, UIC Vice Chancellor for Research.<br><br>
