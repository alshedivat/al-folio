University of Illinois at Chicago&rsquo;s Computer Science Department has been ranked one of the 50 Most Innovative Computer Science Departments in the U.S. by &ldquo;Computer Science Degree Hub&rdquo;. The article notably mentions the department&rsquo;s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Computational Population Biology Laboratory and the Electronic Visualization Laboratory and its CAVE2.<br><br>

#26 Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Chicago - Chicago, Illinois<br><br>

The University of Illinois at Chicago&rsquo;s Department of Computer Science attracts more than $6 million in research endowments every year, helping it to explore a variety of hypothetical and collaborative subjects - everything from artificial intelligence and parallel algorithms to data mining and multimedia communication. Research is undertaken at centers including the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Computational Population Biology Laboratory and the Electronic Visualization Laboratory. It was in the last of these labs that in 2012 researchers launched CAVE2, a next-gen virtual reality interface utilizing both 2D and 3D technology. In early 2013 The Huffington Post reported that CAVE2 brings &ldquo;science fiction closer to reality,&rdquo; highlighting the system&rsquo;s potential to understand &ldquo;large-scale data.&rdquo; The publisher also recognized the interface&rsquo;s more fantastical possibilities - namely, taking a flyover across the surface of Mars or delving deep into the human brain.
