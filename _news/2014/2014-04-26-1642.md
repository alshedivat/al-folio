The scale and complexity of today&rsquo;s datasets frequently overwhelm conventional visualization interfaces, which could negatively impact the quality of the visual analytic activity. In this paper, we investigate the use of Large, High-Resolution displays in exploratory visual analysis scenarios. We argue that the ability to see and interact with more information at once fundamentally affects users&rsquo; analytic behavior, prompting them to explore their data more broadly. This positive effect may also enhance the diversity of questions and hypotheses conceived and explored by users during their analysis.<br><br>
