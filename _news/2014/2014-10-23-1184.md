Copper Giloth received her MFA from the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), a formal joint program of the School of Art &amp; Design and the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and is currently an Associate Professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst&rsquo;s Department of Art.<br><br>

Giloth recently completed her latest interactive real-time computer-graphics art work, called &ldquo;Labyrinth of Fables.&rdquo; It takes you to the 17th century Palace of Versailles in France, which once-upon-a-time contained a labyrinth populated with trees, fences and fountains, each of which illustrated one of Aesop&rsquo;s fables. The Labyrinth existed for just over 100 years, and with this app you can walk around Versailles&rsquo; Grove of the Queen, find the labyrinth&rsquo;s 39 fountains, experience them in 3D, and read each fable and attempt to deduce the moral of the story! When you correctly deduce a moral, the fountain will activate. As you read more fables, the labyrinth will grow around you!<br><br>

The Labyrinth at Versailles was destroyed approximately 250 years ago, but with virtual reality, anyone can once again experience its beauty and grandeur. With a GPS-enabled and gyroscopic device, the user can physically walk the Bosquet de la Reine while viewing the Labyrinth and fountains in 3D. Alternatively, a stationary user can experience the Labyrinth using a computer, tablet or phone&rsquo;s touch and swipe controls to navigate from fountain to fountain.<br><br>

The app is available from the Apple App Store or Google Play for iOS and Android phone / tablet, for Mac and Windows desktops, and via the web. <a href="http://www.labyrinth-of-fables.com">More Information</a>.<br><br>
