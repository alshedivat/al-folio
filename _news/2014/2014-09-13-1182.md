EVL PhD candidate, John S. Novak III demonstrates his Audio Dilation research at the 2014 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing Adjunct Publication (UbiComp 2014 Adjunct), September 13-17, 2014 in Seattle, WA.<br><br>

Audio Dilation is a technique that slows down the tempo of audio signals without changing the pitch or otherwise distorting the sounds. Networked On-line Audio Dilation is an Android application that allows users to dilate audio while engaged in a full-duplex networked conversation. The capability can potentially be used to improve comprehension for hearing or cognitively impaired individuals, or for non-native speakers of foreign languages.
