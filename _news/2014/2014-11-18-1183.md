For those attending SC14 in New Orleans, Louisiana, we will hold the annual &ldquo;Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment (SAGE) for Global Collaboration&rdquo; Birds of a Feather (BOF):<br>
<ul>
<li>Tuesday, November 18</li>
<li>12:15PM - 01:15PM</li>
<li>Room: 393-94-95</li>

We will introduce SAGE2&trade;, the next-generation SAGE&trade;, in addition to providing SAGE updates. SAGE2 is browser-based and integrates cloud services, a multi-resolution image viewer, a stereoscopic image viewer, mirrored portals, and network streaming of high-resolution imagery. Like SAGE middleware, SAGE2 is a software framework that enables local and remote collaboration on scalable resolution display walls (from single monitors to a wall of tiled displays) by sharing diverse media content, including 2D and 3D visualizations and applications. One major benefit of browser-based software is that there is no installation requirement for users and it is inherently cross-platform. A user simply needs an up-to-date web browser on the device he/she wishes to use as an interaction tool for the wall. SAGE2 services are essentially brought to the user through the Cloud.<br><br>

This BOF provides a Forum for the SAGE / SAGE2 developers to meet with the the SAGE global user community and potential users; specifically:<br>
<ul>
<li>to introduce key SAGE / SAGE2 team members</li>
<li>to provide an overview of SAGE / SAGE2 roadmaps</li>
<li>to review SAGE / SAGE2 capabilities and applications</li>
<li>to highlight SAGE / SAGE2 research and education applications</li>
<li>to solicit feedback</li>
</ul><br>

We are planning SAGE2 demonstrations on the SC14 exhibition floor; more information will be forthcoming.<br><br>

Together, we can advance scientific research and education by providing production-quality, community-driven open services for visualization and collaboration that utilize shared national and international cyberinfrastructure.<br><br>

See you at SC14!<br><br>
