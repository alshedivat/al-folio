Twenty innovative Chicagoans are featured in the May 5, 2014 issue of Crain&rsquo;s Chicago Business, in the article &ldquo;20 In Their 20s&rdquo; by Cassie Walker Burke.<br><br>

This &ldquo;Class of 2013&rdquo; is innovative and eager, and each person is making a mark in his/her respective realms - and, they&rsquo;re not yet 30. The article profiles each individual, with a short description of accomplishments, a short video of inspirations and aspirations, and an interactive game for readers to learn more about the people&rsquo;s favorite TV shows, childhood aspirations, and dreams for the future.<br><br>

Victor Mateevitsi, UIC computer science PhD student and research assistant at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory, is featured for his work on &ldquo;SpiderSense.&rdquo;<br><br>
