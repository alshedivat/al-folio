April 29 2014, the UIC Office of Sustainability celebrated the results of its &ldquo;Proud to be Sustainable&rdquo; Photo Contest at the UIC African American Cultural Center gallery. There were a total of 30 submissions that showcased sustainability efforts at UIC, and all were displayed in a slide show. The 12 winning posters hung on the gallery walls. The UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) was one of the winners, having submitted a photo showing a visualization of a 3D sonar mapping of the bathymetry of Lake Bonney, a perennially ice-covered Antarctic dry valley lake in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. It is being viewed by members of the NASA-funded ENDURANCE (Environmentally Non-Disturbing Under-ice Robotic ANtarctic Explorer) project in EVL&rsquo;s CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment. Team members include the UIC EVL and Earth and Environmental Sciences Department, Stone Aerospace, NASA Ames Research Center and Montana State University. &ldquo;EVL is helping people around the world see our complex inter-connected planet through the new lens of data visualization.&rdquo;
