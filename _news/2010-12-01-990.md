December 1, 2010 - Andy Johnson, an associate professor in the UIC Computer Science department (CS) and the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), explains that the CS program emphasizes &ldquo;human-centered computing&rdquo; - getting people to interact with computers in novel ways.<br><br>

While EVL&rsquo;s Cyber-Commons classroom is used for long-distance scientific collaboration via broadband links, it is also used to test new visual technology for classroom use. When a touch screen was added this past summer, it became apparent that the wall of 18 tiled screens could be used as an artist&rsquo;s canvas, and real paint brushes could be used to paint. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s taking advantage of modern tools to give people a new twist on a very old way of doing artwork.&rdquo; As Johnson goes on to explain, &ldquo;&hellip;you grab the brush, hit the wall and you&rsquo;re painting.&rdquo;<br><br>

Undergraduate and graduate students from computer science and new media arts were involved in developing the paint application. JD Pirtle, an MFA student, would like to extend the application &ldquo;to simulate water colors, oils, or spray painting.&rdquo; Arthur Nishimoto, an MS student, would like to give each artist his / her own palette to personalize each individual&rsquo;s artistic contribution.<br><br>

&ldquo;Our students are the ones investigating and creating this, finding the limitations and figuring out how to fix it,&rdquo; Johnson says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s connecting a lot of disciplines together, but if you do it right, you end up with something that seems incredibly simple and really straightforward.&rdquo;<br><br>
