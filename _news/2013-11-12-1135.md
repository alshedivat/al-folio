Victor Mateevitsi, a Research Assistant at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), is one of three UIC Computer Science graduate students who are among the 50 winners of this year&rsquo;s annual Fifty For The Future&reg; Celebration. Organized by the Illinois Technology Foundation, this event recognizes exceptional students with an interest in and potential to use technology in innovative ways.<br><br>

The Fifty For The Future&reg; Celebration provides encouragement and recognition to students who pursue innovation through technology, provides access to business leaders to showcase their talent, and builds awareness of the talent of tomorrow for Illinois&rsquo; technology ecosystem. Winners are chosen through a rigorous nomination and judging process, focused on high school through university and graduate level programs.<br><br>

The formal recognition program will be held at the Chicago Cultural Center on November 12, 2013.
