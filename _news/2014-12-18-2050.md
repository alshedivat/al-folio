<strong>SAGE BIRDS OF A FEATHER (BOF): Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment (SAGE) for Global Collaboration</strong><br><br>

Tuesday, November 18, 2014, 12:15PM - 01:15PM<br>
New Orleans Convention Center, Rooms 393-94-95<br><br>

SAGE2&trade;, the next-generation SAGE, was introduced. SAGE2 is browser-based and integrates cloud services, a multi-resolution image viewer, a stereoscopic image viewer, mirrored portals, and network streaming of high-resolution imagery. Like SAGE middleware, SAGE2 is a software framework that enables local and remote collaboration on scalable resolution display walls (from single monitors to a wall of tiled displays) by sharing diverse media content, including 2D and 3D visualizations and applications. One major benefit of browser-based software is that there is no installation requirement for users and it is inherently cross-platform. A user simply needs an up-to-date web browser on the device he/she wishes to use as an interaction tool for the wall. SAGE2 services are essentially brought to the user through the Cloud.<br><br>

This BOF provided a Forum for the SAGE/SAGE2 developers to meet with the the SAGE global user community and potential users; specifically:<br>
<ul>
<li>to introduce key SAGE/SAGE2 team members</li>
<li>to provide an overview of SAGE/SAGE2 roadmaps</li>
<li>to review SAGE/SAGE2 capabilities and applications</li>
<li>to highlight SAGE/SAGE2 research and education applications</li>
<li>to solicit feedback</li>
</ul>
<br>

In addition, SAGE2 demonstrations took place in the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) research booth on the exhibition floor.<br><br>
