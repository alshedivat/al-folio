The Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) developed &ldquo;Virtual Spaces&rdquo;, which was an allied event for the ISEA &rsquo;97 Conference. &ldquo;Virtual Spaces&rdquo; was installed at the Gallery 400 and in EVL&rsquo;s newly constructed &lsquo;production&rsquo; CAVE on the UIC campus located in the Science and Engineering Laboratory facility.<br><br>

The Gallery 400 exhibit consisted of virtual reality displays using an ImmersaDesk, ImmersaDesk2, as well as video installations, performance art and 2-dimensional digital media displays. Two EVL MFA thesis shows, produced by Joe Insley and Maria Roussou were held in conjunction with this event. Their work included: <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/mariar/MFA/CLEANSE/">[cleanse]</a>, <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/mariar/MFA/MITOLOGIES/">Mitologies</a>, <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/insley/MFA/NOTITLE/">Lucifer Lounge</a>, and <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/insley/MFA/WATERLOGGED/">Waterlogged</a>.<br><br>

The body of work comprising the remainder of the &ldquo;Virtual Spaces&rdquo; show is listed below under related research.
