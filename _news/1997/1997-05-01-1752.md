The newly built Franklin Delano Roosevelt National Monument serves as a focal point for this immersive experience, which addresses issues germane to the disabled community and to representation of minorities in general. FDR, a hero for his progressive social policies and programs, is typically represented as standing or seated, although for most of his life he used a wheelchair. The Disabled Rights movement foregrounds issues which challenge one notions of the disabled as whole people, and this work forces us to consider point of view as a factor in how we have historically understood and represented disability.<br><br>

From his involvement in the disabled community as an activist and artist, he built on the definition of &ldquo;Disability Culture&rdquo;. This piece utilizes Virtual Reality Modeling Language to construct and animate that environment.
