The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign was named a recipient of the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s new Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (PACI) program. Their award winning proposal, the National Computational Science Alliance, calls for the creation of a partnership of centers of excellence, hereafter called the &ldquo;Alliance&rdquo;, to prototype a computational infrastructure for the Nation for the 21st century. EVL is an Alliance partner and will work with other institutions to further develop collaborative tele-immersive virtual reality tool, techniques and methodologies.
