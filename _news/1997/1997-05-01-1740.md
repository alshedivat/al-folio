&ldquo;Poverty Island with Video Skies&rdquo; is the beginning of an exploration of the integration of video images into a virtual environment. This integration will allow me to combine a long-standing interest in the evocative similarities of the forms and movements in nature with the forms and movements expressed in mathematics.<br><br>

In this work a time-lapse 360 degree panorama is created based on video images captured on Poverty Island, an Island in the archipelago from Death&rsquo;s Door to the Garden Peninsula in Lake Michigan. This environment is processed in a manner closely related to the video synthesis art of the seventies.<br><br>

The luminescent waterfall is an entirely synthetic environment based on a very simple mathematical model that simulates falling water. This particle system interacts both with the virtual world and the human participant.
