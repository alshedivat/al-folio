Joe Reitzer (Adjunct Assistant Professor, School of Art &amp; Design and EVL alumni) presented &ldquo;Vibescape II&rdquo;, using the <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/art/template_art_project.php3?indi=45">VibraFloor</a> at ACM &rsquo;97. This exhibit marked the 50th anniversary of the ACM organization and featured digital and computer media events/exhibits as part of the celebration.<br><br>

&ldquo;Vibescape II&rdquo; is a virtual music / sound instrument that the participants or presenter can perform on, creating a unique vibratory soundscape and experience in real-time. The immersive audio environment that &ldquo;Vibescape II&rdquo; creates, allows the attendees to &ldquo;forget themselves,&rdquo; while sitting, or standing on the VibraFloor and composing a digital symphony.
