Strait Dope is a CAVE&trade; and ImmersaDesk&trade; virtual environment that emphasizes participant interaction.<br><br>

Strait Dope colors thought and decision making by presenting unfamiliar elements in settings which operate under an alternate logic. Participants discover their own path to confront a subversive world of colors, characters, voices and noises.
