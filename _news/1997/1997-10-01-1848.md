The TeraGrid DTFnet is an anchor tenant at StarLight, where EVL works with networking engineers from Argonne National Laboratory and Northwestern University to design and build a co-location facility that provides a seamless global infrastructure for its collaborators. EVL is also developing data and visualization TeraNodes, or on-ramps to gigabit / terabit infobahns, as well as application-centric cluster access tools and techniques for such resources.
