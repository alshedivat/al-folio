A virtual rendition (VRML) of Korean sites will allow visitors to explore these national treasures from Kyoungju City. Along the way visitors may ring the temple bell, or cast lots to ask their future of the I Ching, or Book of Changes. At each of the four sites, a Korean myth is told by text and the interactive animations.
