STAR TAP - Science, Technology And Research Transit Access Point - is a model for international high-performance networking that will facilitate scientific collaborations on such computationally demanding and data-intensive topics as global climate change, protein structures, nanomaterials, video streaming, and interactive virtual reality. STAR TAP is being organized by researchers at EVL, NCSA and Argonne National Laboratory.
