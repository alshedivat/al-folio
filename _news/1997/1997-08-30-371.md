Designed by <a href="http://www.mcs.net/~rogala/">Miroslaw Rogala</a> and created by <a href="http://www.artn.com">(art)n Laboratory</a> and Alan Cruz, a series of &lsquo;Interactive&rsquo; PHSColograms are included in the work entitled &ldquo;Divided We Speak&rdquo;. This work was displayed at the Chicago Museum of Conteporary Art Video Gallery, 2nd Floor through November 9, 1997.<br><br>

For the first time ever, the works include an interactive audio component, which engages the audience in not only stunning auto-stereo imagery, but a cacophony of sounds that enhances each piece.<br><br>

One of the PHSColograms in this series is included in the MCA&rsquo;s permanent collection.
