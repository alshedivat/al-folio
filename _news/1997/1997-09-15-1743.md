Grid is an endless cyberspace gallery of sculptural mandalas. The grid of &ldquo;jacks&rdquo; are portals into alternatives spaces where the sculpture can be observed. There are obvious exits as marked by spheres with targets which lead you back to the central grid space.<br><br>

The Grid apart from creating a virtual environment also creates a non-linear musical composition and navigation system / code for viewing art in cyberspace.
