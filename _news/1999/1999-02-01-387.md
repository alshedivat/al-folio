EVL&rsquo;s collaboration with NTT and the University of Tokyo continues when researchers from Japan visit EVL to continue work on the N*Vector project. This work will lead to a high-speed connection between EVL&rsquo;s CAVE and the <a href="http://www.ihl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/Projects/CABIN/">CABIN</a> at the University of Tokyo.<br><br>

N*Vector is Networked Virtual Environments Collaborative Trans-Oceanic Research. This is a three-way joint research project in advanced networking and tele-immersion between EVL, <a href="http://www.ntt.co.jp/index.html">NTT</a> Optical Network Systems Laboratory in Yokosuka, Japan, and the <a href="http://www.iml.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index-e.html">Intelligent Modeling Laboratory</a> at the University of Tokyo.
