&ldquo;VEIL - For the Queen of All Our Hearts&rdquo; is a collaborative web art piece. Utilizing material appropriated from other websites, its imagery deals with contemporary apparitions of the Virgin Mary. The original text extends the tradition of medieval Marian poetry. &ldquo;Seeing is believing&rdquo;.
