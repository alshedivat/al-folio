ALIVE will allow Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas to work on his design for the New Campus Center at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago without leaving Holland.<br><br>

Koolhaas / Office of Metropolitan Architecture won the <a href="http://www.iit.edu/departments/pr/arch.comp/index.html">Richard Driehaus Foundation International Award</a> for the design of the New Campus Center in February 1998. Now the architects in Amsterdam and their clients in Chicago will be utilizing CAVE to CAVE Tele-Immersion technology between EVL and <a href="http://www.sara.nl/">SARA (Academic Computing Services Amsterdam)</a> to perform collaborative design reviews.<br><br>

EVL and SARA have developed a collaborative version of the SARANAV CAVE navigation tool. The architects will be using the SARANAV CAVE navigation tool to load three-dimensional CAD models. This allows viewers to navigate through, create and re-play previously recorded animation paths. <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/">CAVERNsoft</a> was used to provide SARANAV with avatars, audio conferencing, and network instrumentation for monitoring bandwidth utilization, latency and jitter of network traffic during collaborative sessions.<br><br>

ALIVE gives EVL another opportunity to monitor network utilization in a real world Tele-Immersion  application.<br><br>

The researchers involved with this project are Edward J. Breedveld, Jorrit Adriaanse, Anton Koning, Paul Wielinga - SARA and  Jason Leigh, Dana Plepys - EVL.
