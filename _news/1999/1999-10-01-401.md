<a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/cavernG2">CAVERNsoft G2</a> is a C++ toolkit for building collaborative networked applications or &ldquo;logistical networking&rdquo; applications. It has low and mid level networking classes to support general collaborative application building, and it has higher level modules to specifically support Tele-Immersion (or collaborative virtual reality).<br><br>

The distribution includes full source for SGI, Linux, and NT. Currently graphics support is only supported on the SGI through IRIS Performer. The distribution comes with the full source of Globus 1.1 and allows you to generate both <a href="http://www.globus.org">Globus</a> and non-Globus versions of CAVERNSoft.
