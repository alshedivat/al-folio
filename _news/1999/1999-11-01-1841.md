<strong>Artist Statement:</strong> This series of photographs depicts interaction within a population confined to a restricted space. The population residing within the space is engaging the complete life cycle - reproducing, maturing, dying, &hellip;evolving. Outside influences can superficially alter individuals&rsquo; life paths, but ultimately the entire population must conscientiously consent to harmoniously cooperation to survive. The final works are documentation of their lives taken at moments in which their interactions express the essence of existence.<br><br>
