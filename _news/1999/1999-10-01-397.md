EVL has installed an <em>ImmersaDesk</em> in the Abraham Lincoln Elementary school as a continuation of research into the use of virtual reality and tele-immersion in education. The <em>ImmersaDesk</em> will be a fixture at the school for the next two or three years.<br><br>

Students at Lincoln will continue to take part in the <em>Round Earth</em> project - which investigates how virtual reality technology can be used to help teach concepts that are counter-intuitive to a learner&rsquo;s currently held mental model.<br><br>

EVL researchers are also developing new projects for the school, including <em>Correlations</em> - an investigation into the effectiveness of virtual environments as simulated data collection environments for children engaged in inquiry-based science learning activities, and  the <em>QuickWorlds</em> project - which lets the teachers request 3D virtual models to enhance their existing curriculum.
