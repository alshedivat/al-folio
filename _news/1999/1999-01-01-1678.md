The Collaborative Image Based Rendering Viewer (or CIBRView) is a CAVERNsoft-based tool for viewing animated sequences of image based renderings from volume data. CIBRView was designed to allow DOE scientists to view volume renderings composed of 2D image slices. CIBRView allows collaboration on a variety of visualization platforms - from desktop workstations to CAVEs.
