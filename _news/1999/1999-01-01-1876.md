The Cylindrical Varrier&trade; display consists of 35 LCD panels tiled in a 7x5 configuration with a 6&rsquo;x8&rsquo; footprint. A photographic film barrier screen affixed to a glass panel is mounted to the front of each of the 21&rdquo; LCD panels.<br><br>

This configuration has approximately 3000 lines of horizontal resolution and 6000 lines of vertical resolution. The horizontal angle of view is between 100 and 180 degrees. EVL&rsquo;s Varrier computational technique generates a real-time Virtual Reality stereo graphic experience.<br><br>

Varrier is a head-tracked autostereo virtual reality display. The display eliminates the need to wear special glasses to see the stereoscopic image, and yet still affords the user an effective sense of immersion.<br><br>

In the Varrier method, a virtual barrier screen is created simulating the physical barrier screen, and placed in the virtual world in front of the projection plane. An off-axis perspective projection of this barrier screen, combined with the rest of the virtual world, is projected from at least two viewpoints corresponding to the eye positions of the head-tracked viewer.<br><br>

A real-time (640x480 at 30Hz) camera-based 3D head position and orientation tracking system is currently in development to replace the InterSense IS900 acoustic inertial tracking system now in use. The new head tracker is based on a SOM neural network system and is trainable to an individual face.
