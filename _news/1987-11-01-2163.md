Held in Washington, DC, February 9-10, 1987 a workshop brought together researchers from academia, industry and government to showcase examples of their computer-generated imagery using film, videotape and slides, and to discuss visualization, state-of-the-art computer graphics animation research, and commercially available hardware and software.  Co-chaired by Panel members Bruce H. McCormick and Thomas A. DeFanti, the Panel of computer graphics and computer vision experts analyzed emerging technologies, and federal agency representatives presented their needs and interests.  The results of the Workshop culminated in the <i>Visualization in Scientific Computing</i> report.
