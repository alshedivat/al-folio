At the Apple Special Event, September 2014, Kevin Lynch, vice president of technology at Apple, introduced Apple Watch. Lynch now runs the team working on Apple&rsquo;s wearable technologies. In a September 17, 2014 CNET story about the Apple Watch introduction, titled <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/meet-kevin-lynch-once-a-flash-point-now-winding-up-apple-watch/">&ldquo;Meet Kevin Lynch, once a Flash point, now winding up Apple Watch,&rdquo;</a> it mentions that he he studied interactive computer graphics at the University of Illinois, working with artists and engineers in the Electronic Visualization Laboratory.<br><br>

In a 2013 interview, when he was CTO of Adobe, he was quoted in the &ldquo;Blog of Appliness&rdquo; saying: &ldquo;To me, creative expression is technical, and at the same time technology opens new doors to creativity. I learned this early on as I worked for a time as a member of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory in college. I was an engineer sitting at a workbench right next to artists using the software we developed.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.appliness.com/kevin-lynch/">Read the article.</a><br><br>

Note: While a UIC student in the 80s studying CS, he left to help establish a Mac software startup. He never did finish his degree. But, it is clear that his experiences at EVL have been a major influence in his life and career.
