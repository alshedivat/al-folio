EVL PhD candidate Thomas Marrinan presents <em>Whole-Brain Vascular Reconstruction, Simulation, and Visualization</em> at VisWeek 2012 in Seattle, Washington, October 14-19, 2012.  The poster was awarded an Honorable Mention.<br><br>

Authored by Thomas Marrinan, Ian Gould, Chih-Yang Hsu and Andreas Linninger from the University of Illinois at Chicago, the poster presents a pipeline for processing medical data and executing computational simulations to enhance the information conveyed in standard medical imaging. The work focuses on the whole brain, where tools have been developed that allow vasculature to be analyzed in three-dimensions, at high resolutions, and with multiple relevant data sets overlaid on the vascular structure. In order to avoid confusion and misinterpretations, the application has the ability to render simulated data such that it mirrors raw medical images and vascular reconstructions.
Centerlines can be extracted directly from images since they exist on local ridges, defined by image color intensities.
