The SAGE3 Team has been quiet far too long, but we&rsquo;ve been very busy! Here&rsquo;s what to look forward to in the coming months:<br><br>
* SAGE3 beta version software with documentation will be released the week of the IEEE/ACM Supercomputing (SC22) conference, to be held in Dallas, Texas, USA, November 13-18, 2022. More information about the release will be forthcoming. For information on SC22, see: <a href="https://sc22.supercomputing.org/">https://sc22.supercomputing.org/</a><br><br>
* A 1-hour SAGE3 Birds of a Feather (BoF) session and ongoing demonstrations and presentations will take place during SC22. At the BoF (Tuesday, Nov 15 from 12:15-13:15 in Room D168), the SAGE3 team will introduce the latest software release. The team will also share a booth in the research exhibition (StarLight booth #2847 as well as partner booths) and will conduct demos and presentations. More information will be forthcoming.<br><br>
* Educational SAGE3 webinars will be held, starting next year. Team members will present SAGE3&rsquo;s features and capabilities, provide use cases, answer questions, and solicit user feedback and use cases. More information will be forthcoming.<br><br>
