MS student Khairi Reda, and BS student Ed Kahler spend their summer at the Science Museum of Minnesota to help them build the Lambda Table - the highest resolution (24 Megapixel) LCD table-oriented display in the world. Lambda Table will be part of a traveling exhibit called Water Planet that enables the general public to understand the effect of water on geologic processes. Water Planet is scheduled to tour Chicago in the Fall of 2009.<br><br>

The students were also at the museum to teach exhibit designers how to build a 4-Megapixel LCD-based multi-touch table - currently also the highest resolution in the world.<br><br>

Reda and Kahler are both funded by EVL through grants from the National Science Foundation.
