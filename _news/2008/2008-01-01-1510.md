<em>Cyber-mashups of very large data sets let users explore, analyze, and comprehend the science behind the information being streamed.</em><br><br>

As longtime Communications subscribers, as well as authors of articles and contributors to special sections, notably &ldquo;Blueprint for the Future of High-Performance Computing&rdquo; (November 1997) and &ldquo;Blueprint for the Future of High-Performance Networking&rdquo; (November 2003), we appreciate the opportunity to learn from and share with the ACM community. Over the next 50 years, as computing and networking technologies advance, we&rsquo;ll have to be able to harness the power of technology to address challenges involving biodiversity, the environment, medicine, energy, and more. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re creating visualization and collaboration user interfaces to enable global virtual organizations to work together. Happy Birthday, CACM, and many more.<br><br>

As educators, researchers, and specialists in networked visualization, virtual reality, and collaboration technologies, we are fortunate to work at an institution - the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago - with access to some of the most advanced &ldquo;cyberinfrastructure&rdquo; in the world. That term, coined by the National Science Foundation, refers to high-performance computing and communications environments that integrate data, computers, and people on a global scale in order to stimulate scientific exploration, theories, and knowledge.<br><br>
