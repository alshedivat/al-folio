The Networking Research Challenges Workshop (NRC) brings together visionaries, designers, developers and researchers of advanced networking technologies to identify the future challenges of networking associated with:<br>
<ul>
<li>Next-Generation heterogeneous networking (convergence of optical, wireless, packets-switched, and dynamic circuit-switched network)</li>
<li>Network security</li>
<li>Federated heterogeneous networking and internetworking: resource reservation, security, management, performance monitoring, fault diagnosis, etc.</li>
<li>Networking challenges: 100Gb+ data transport, end-to-end optical transport, cross-layer communications in dynamically reconfigurable optical networks, optical packet switching to eliminate router bottlenecks, sensornets, secure dynamic mobile networking</li>
</ul><br>

EVL international networking research co-investigators (NSF TransLight / StarLight), Tom DeFanti and Maxine Brown serve on the NRC Program Committee to shape workshop content, and to help foster collaboration and cooperation between all interested participants.
