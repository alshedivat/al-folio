<em>Europa Here We Come: NASA Tests Under-Ice Sub with Eye Toward Jupiter - If successful at mapping lake terrain Wisconsin and Antarctica, it could be used to search for life in the ocean on Jupiter&rsquo;s moon</em><br><br>

Researchers from NASA and the University of Illinois at Chicago atop the frozen surface of Wisconsin&rsquo;s Lake Mendota this week are preparing for interplanetary exploration. Below them, under a sheet of ice more than a foot (30 centimeters) thick, the space agency&rsquo;s new Environmentally Non-Disturbing Under-Ice Robotic Antarctic Explorer (ENDURANCE) maps the lake&rsquo;s underwater terrain. If this and subsequent voyages are successful, a similar vessel could be sent to navigate the suspected liquid water under the frozen surface of the ocean on Jupiter&rsquo;s moon Europa by the year 2028.<br><br>

ENDURANCE, a $2.3-million project funded by NASA&rsquo;s Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets (ASTEP) program, is an autonomous vehicle designed to operate underwater below the ice. Its mission: to gather environmental data (such as samples of microbial life) and create three-dimensional maps of undersea topography.
ENDURANCE&rsquo;S top shell resembles a crab, but its underbelly has a variety of sensors that measure temperature, light and water chemistry.
