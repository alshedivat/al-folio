EVL MFA candidate AnnMarie Cernoch is awarded the UIC Graduate College&rsquo;s support under the Spring 2008 Provost&rsquo;s Award for Graduate Research for her thesis project entitled, <em>Replication of System, 2008</em>.<br><br>

<em>Replication of System, 2008</em> is an interactive kinetic sculpture creating a spatial circuit through user input from contact sensors extended in space and attached to surfaces it occupies. A replication system represents the flow of information, which is expressed via electrical impulses to a central core. Vine-like appendages radiating from the sculpture take on the function of sound sensitive ears to interactively communicate with its audience.<br><br>

The generous support provided by the UIC Graduate College&rsquo;s Provost award will contribute to the refinement and expansion of Ms. Cernoch&rsquo;s thesis research.
