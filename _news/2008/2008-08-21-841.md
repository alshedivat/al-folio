Director Jason Leigh presents &ldquo;The Global Cyber-Commons&rdquo; at the 2008 iCORE (Informatics Circle of Research Excellence) Banff Summit, August 21-23, 2008.  iCORE&rsquo;s goal for this Banff Summit is to explore how Collaboration, Visualization, and Interaction can solve some of the issues that have come up these last 20 years thanks to the &ldquo;information big bang&rdquo;; the exponential explosion of data the world has experienced. The iCORE Summit presenters and attendees explore how local and international research expertise in informatics and related areas can contribute to new collaborative explorations and research in Alberta, Canada.<br><br>

Dr. Leigh&rsquo;s presentation summarizes EVL&rsquo;s research interest in developing collaboration technologies and techniques for supporting a wide range of applications ranging from the remote exploration of large-scale data, education and entertainment.
