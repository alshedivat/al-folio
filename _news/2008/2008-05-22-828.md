<strong>MFA THESIS PROJECTS ON DISPLAY INCLUDE:</strong><br>
<strong><a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=2&amp;indi=380">Replication of System</a></strong><br>
AnnMarie Cernoch, Ratko Jagodic<br>
2008<br><br>

<em>Replication of System</em> is a computer-based interactive sculpture inspired by intercellular communication in the brain. Sound and vibration detected by cardioid and wall-mounted microphones in the sculpture&rsquo;s environment provide the stimuli for its movement and illumination.<br><br>

<strong>BendyBots</strong><br>
AnnMarie Cernoch, Ratko Jagodic<br>
2007-2008<br><br>

<em>BendyBots</em> is a collection of twenty animatronic objects inspired by oceanic plant life. An electroluminescent wire illuminates each object, made of plastic and monofilament fishing line. A flexinol&trade;-based pulley system makes the BendyBots sway gently in an invisible underwater current.<br><br>

<strong>Infinity Gliders High-definition video documentation</strong><br>
AnnMarie Cernoch, Luc Renambot, Dmitry Svistula<br>

<em>Infinity Gliders</em> is a robotic installation. Small magnetic robots powered by micro Servomotors traverse an infinite landscape perpetuated by a two-way mirror and a glass mirror. The Infinity Gliders are hypothetical life forms that inhabit the void between the physical world and spatial infinity.
