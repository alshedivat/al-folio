<em>The Viewer</em> consists on a virtual viewer situated in front of the real viewer, and deals with the visualization and comprehension strategies of the work of art. It presents an interactive device that establishes a relation of visual communication with the audience, showing how the viewer acts in relation to the art piece.<br><br>

The Viewer deals with the artwork-viewer communication through a direct and simple, but at the same time extreme interaction, as the only activity the virtual viewer performs is to observe the public around him, controlling them visually, reproducing audience behavior.<br><br>

The project tries to invert the usual artwork-viewer relation, being in this case the piece who watches the audience, making them to become aware of their own behavior.<br><br>
