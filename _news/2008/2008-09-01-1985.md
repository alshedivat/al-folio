<em>Building Music</em> is a public large scale interactive installation that explores the musicality of different architectural features. By moving the light of a torch (flashlight) along the facade of the building the viewers create musical compositions while lighting the windows. Every window hides a sound and a color and the spectators can play with them from a distance.<br><br>

<em>Building Music</em> has been exhibited at the Urban Art Festival (White Night, Bucharest, 2008) and The Spark Festival of Electronic Music and Arts (Minneapolis, 2009).
