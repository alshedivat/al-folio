<em>Replication of System, 2008</em> is an interactive, kinetic, sculptural installation, that explores communication through computer-human interaction and visual feedback.  The human brain is the inspiration for the sculpture&rsquo;s communication system; a central control unit receives a sigal (sound input from cardioid microphones) which then transmits electrical impulses throughout the interactive spatial circuit. At the core of the system is an Arduino board - a physical computing platform based on a simple I/O board and a development environment that uses the Processing / Wiring language. The core represents the systems &ldquo;nucleus&rdquo; from which the flow of information or data radiates. Contact sensors are connected to vine-like appendages that extend from the sculpture and are attached to various surfaces within the space it occupies. These &ldquo;tentacles&rdquo; act like sound sensitive ears, collecting input from participants through surface vibration. User input triggers a series of LEDs to illuminate and sound to be output via Piezo speakers and tranducers. The sculpture&rsquo;s mood or reaction is directly correlated to the nature of the user interaction; if the user pounds a surface rapidly, the system will respond vibrantly to reflect an aggressive reaction.<br><br>

<em>Replication of System</em> creates a feeling of ever expansive growth and informational movement. The project consists of a chaotic wire-filled nucleus that is attached to two sets of consecutive rings. Stretching out from the center of the project are vine-like arms that contain the small, yet powerful sound sensors. The appendages are attached to walls and flat surfaces in the space it occupies. A diffused spotlight illuminates the sculpture to create a sparkling coagulation of copper wire. As one moves around the piece, the illusion of growing wires emerges adding movement / life to the sculpture.<br><br>

<em>Replication of System</em> is an exploration into how technology is an extension of the human mind. Using our brains as inspiration, we are expanding technological systems to create what was once perceived as impossible.
