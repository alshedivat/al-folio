Researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) will showcase major advancements in high-definition telecommuting in the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) booth at SC&rsquo;08.<br><br>

Ultra-fast, ultra-high-resolution instruments used by distributed teams of domain scientists to visualize and analyze massive datasets will be on exhibit. A UIC-developed 52-inch LCD table display with touch interface will run microbiology, map and space science content; a 65-inch Sharp 4K LCD will display 4K video streamed from the CineGrid Exchange using SAGE software; and UCSD&rsquo;s 15-tile LCD wall will showcase GPU-rendered Mars data and a CGLX software-driven genome visualization application.<br><br>

UCSD and UIC will showcase gigabit-linked, high-performance visualization environments and with SDSC will give presentations on how each supports scientific teams. These institutions advance discoveries in many scientific domains, while reducing the need for air travel and its environmental impact.
