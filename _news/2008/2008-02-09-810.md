The Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at UIC, and the California Institute of Information Technology and Telecommunications (CALIT2) at UCSD deploy a 55 Megapixel tiled LCD display called the &ldquo;SharpWall&rdquo; at Sharp Labs in Portland, Oregon.<br><br>

Sharp believes that the future for its company is in displays that can cover all the walls in a room. Building the SharpWall and working with the world&rsquo;s leading researchers in the field at UIC and UCSD allows Sharp to study a variety of research issues ranging from their construction, to human-computer interfaces, to future applications.<br><br>

The SharpWall will be driven by EVL&rsquo;s scalable tiled display software called SAGE (the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment), an operating system for managing ultra-high-resolution display environments.<br><br>
