<em>Former Calit2 Staff Researcher at UC San Diego Was &ldquo;Born an Engineer&rdquo;</em><br><br>

Javier Girado has come a long way since being unable to pay his rent as an electronics researcher in Argentina. After losing all his savings not once but three times in the financial collapses of the Argentine economy, Girado moved to the United States for his Ph.D. and eventually landed at the University of California, San Diego doing research at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2). But early this year, Girado got an offer he couldn&rsquo;t refuse: to work in the private sector at roughly double his academic salary.<br><br>

Now Girado is working at QUALCOMM Inc., one of the top 100 employers in the country (according to Fortune magazine). He received stock and a signing bonus, and above all, he gets to continue doing what he loves best. &ldquo;My passion is research,&rdquo; says Girado. &ldquo;I am a practical person and I want to solve problems. I think I was born an engineer.&rdquo;
Javier Girado&rsquo;s research at Calit2 included computer vision-based head tracking for the Personal Varrier, a true-3D teleconferencing system.
