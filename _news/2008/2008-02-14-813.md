Laura Wolf attended the 2008 Annual Meeting of AAAS in Boston February 14-18, where she met with meeting attendees and the general public to explain the NSF-funded International Research Network Connections (IRNC) program and the OptIPuter project. She participated in several scientific visualization application demonstrations with collaborators Joe Keefe and Phil Weber, both of UCSD / Calit2, using the OptIPortable, a 15 panel high-resolution LCD display.<br><br>

<strong>About AAAS</strong><br>
Each year at the AAAS Annual Meeting, science and technology professionals - from across disciplines and around the world - gather to discuss new research, emerging trends, and exciting new possibilities.<br><br>

The theme of this meeting, <em>Science and Technology from a Global Perspective</em>, emphasized the power of science and technology as well as education to assist less-developed segments of the world society, to improve partnerships among already-developed countries, and to spur knowledge-driven transformation across a host of fields.
