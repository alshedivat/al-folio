MS Graduate candidate, Khairi Reda represented EVL with collaborators from the Science Museum of Minnesota to exhibit RainTable using the multi-touch TacTile display system at the AGU Fall Meeting 2008.  Held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, CA the Science Museum&rsquo;s booth showcased RainTable, which is part of their traveling <em>Water</em> exhibition designed to educate participants on how water flows over geographical terrain. Attendees experience RainTable using TacTile, EVL&rsquo;s newly developed display system designed to address the need for multi-person, unencumbered, and intuitive interaction for broad public use such as in museum settings.<br><br>

The annual AGU Meeting attracts over 15,000 researchers, students, and consultants to review the latest issues and studies of the Earth, the planets, and their environment in space.
