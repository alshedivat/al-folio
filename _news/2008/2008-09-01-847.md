The September 2008 issue of Campus Technology carries a higher education brief of EVL&rsquo;s recently awarded National Science Foundation major research instrumentation grant.<br><br>

The Brief States:<br>
&ldquo;Look Mom, No Goggles or Gloves!<br>
The Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago is building a high-end virtual reality device with a major research instrumentation grant of $450,000 from the National Science Foundation (<a href="http://www.nsf.gov">www.nsf.gov</a>). The device, called the OmegaTable, is a modular multisensory touch tabletop for interactive exploration of visual 2D and 3D data (and follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, the LambdaTable). The OmegaTable allows users to engage in visualization without special goggles, gloves or handheld controllers, opening up a range of possibilities for research and instruction.&rdquo;
