<strong>SC08 Bandwidth Challenge Session</strong><br>
Unleashing the Power of the Network<br>
Tuesday,  01:45PM - 02:00PM<br>
Room 17A/17B<br><br>

<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Advanced networks are giving rise to a new kind of collaborative laboratory, or collaboratory, comprised of scientists in far-flung locations working together and sharing information as if in the same room, in real time, and aided by high-resolution imagery and high-definition (HD) video conferencing. From 2002-2008, a global team of researchers and networking engineers has been building the OptIPuter, a NSF-funded initiative to dynamically configure a distributed computational facility, where the optical network becomes the &lsquo;backplane&rsquo; connecting high-end computing, storage and visualization resources. The <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/optiplanet">OptIPlanet Collaboratory</a> is now being built through the deployment of OptIPuter-developed tools to global user communities. Currently, 33 sites around the world are part of this collaboratory. For the Bandwidth Challenge, we intend to demonstrate global visualcasting - a technique for leveraging high performance networking and computing to enable distributed collaborative visualization at extremely high resolution on OptIPortals.
