Paige Treebridge&rsquo;s video <em>snstncntnr.1</em> was screened as part of the T-10 Video Festival at 21 Grand, an interdisciplinary arts space in Oakland, California. <em>snstncntnr.1</em> is an open source work and part of a larger effort to create and distribute open source &ldquo;sensation containers&rdquo; as XML and EDL video edit files.<br><br>

About <em>snstncntnr.1</em>:<br>
Outside there is something opening, we watch. What did happen? Utilizing the chance operations of broken telematic machines to scramble and reorganize a fictional reality, frame by frame, <em>snstncntnr.1</em> is an open work. The structure has been released to the Internet as XML and EDL - <a href="http://www.snstncntnrs.org">www.snstncntnrs.org</a> so that anyone can apply it to video, or apply video to it.
Still from <em>snstncntnr.1</em>
