The editors of &ldquo;Communications of the ACM&rdquo; (CACM) created a special January 2008 issue of the magazine to celebrate CACM&rsquo;s 50th anniversary, and invited long-time contributors Jason Leigh and Maxine Brown of UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) to submit an article that reflects EVL&rsquo;s past achievements and future directions in visualization and networking.<br><br>

&ldquo;Cyber-Commons: Merging Real and Virtual Worlds&rdquo; describes the advancements EVL has made over several decades - from networked CAVE virtual environments to networked &ldquo;cyber-commons&rdquo; collaboration spaces. Cyber-Commons spaces enable remote colleagues to better understand complex systems by facilitating the creation of &ldquo;cyber-mashups&rdquo; from multiple terabyte data stores, which are then collaboratively viewed and analyzed on ultra-high-resolution tiled display walls.<br><br>

EVL envisions Cyber-Commons as a community resource for scientists as well as for students, providing a powerful and easy-to-use information-rich environment for scientific discovery and education.<br><br>
