## The Spacepad



![image](/images/space3.jpg-srcw.jpg){:style="max-width: 100%"}

The <a href='http://www.ascension-tech.com/products/spacepad/'>Spacepad</a> magnetic tracking system used with the ImmersaDesk is a plug-in PC ISA bus system and has the following components:<br>
<ul>
<li>Antenna, which consists of three wire loops mounted on plywood and configured on a flat plane that is inclined at 35 degrees, and held in place above the I-Desk. During shipping the antenna piece is removed and flipped over the screen to protect it.</li>
<li>The transmitter and the receivers are integrated into the PC board.</li>
<li>2 receiving antennae - one attached to the glasses and one to the wand (if more receiving antennae are used, more receiver cards must be added to the PC).</li>
<li>The Spacepad PC card communicates with the SGI.</li>
</ul>
