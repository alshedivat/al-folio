The <a href='http://www.ascension-tech.com/products/pcibird.php'>pcBIRD</a> is a 6 DOF pc-based tracking device that measures the position and orientation of a small body-mounted receiver when located within +/- 4 feet of its transmitter. The pcBIRD determines position and orientation by transmitting a pulsed DC magnetic field that is measured by the receiver.<br><br>

EVL has investigated use of the pcBIRD in a number of applications, most notably as the tracking system for the experimental ImmersaDesk3.
