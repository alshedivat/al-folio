&ldquo;The Cosmic Explorer&rdquo; is a research tool for exploring the stages of the evolution of the universe. We visualize the result of numerical simulations to allow the exploration of the formation of the universe, astrophysical jets, and colliding galaxies. This application, originally written for the BOOM, is being ported to the CAVE.<br><br>

&ldquo;The Cosmic Explorer&rdquo; premiered at the Showcase exhibit at SIGGRAPH 92, Chicago.
