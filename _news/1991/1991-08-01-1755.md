This application is an example of sensory evoked potentials mapped onto a 3D surface model of a human head.<br><br>

Included in the model is a 3D brain surface originally from MRI data and polygonalized to produce real-time graphics. The head model is a clay model scanned in using a Cyberware laser scanner, and is also polygonalized.<br><br>

The voltage potentials are measured off the head using 21 separate electrodes. The electrodes measure brain activity. The recordings were made during an experiment in which a patient is shown a checker- board pattern. In addition, recordings were made during a stimulation of the tibial nerve. The resultant voltage potentials were recorded over brief time periods (approximately 10 milliseconds) and the range of voltages is mapped onto a color scale. The color values are then placed on the head model and interpolated producing color gradations. Areas of increased, decreased, and static brain activity can then be visualized.<br><br>

&ldquo;Mapping of Cognitive Function with Subdural Electrodes?&rdquo; premiered at the Showcase exhibit at SIGGRAPH 92, Chicago.
