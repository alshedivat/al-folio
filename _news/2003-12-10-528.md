<em>&ldquo;Of all the arts, dance would seem the least likely to accede to the vagaries of rapid change and the relentless advances of modern technology. Dance, the art of human movement, on the surface appears non technologically inclined. It is the self-sufficient art.&rdquo;</em><br>
- Judith A. Gray<br><br>

Just because dance seems to be a self-sufficient art, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that one couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;accessorize&rsquo;, expand and experiment, as Judith Gray would put it. Labanotation gave rise to interests in isolation of movement, decentralization and unconventional ways of reaching balance. Video art opened the path to projections for staging and intangible partnering opportunities. Then came motion capture, tracking, virtual reality and so much more. We are at a point in time at which we can critique the evolution of computing in the performing arts, yet some still treat the relationship as a novelty thinking that &ldquo;it too will pass&rdquo;.<br><br>

The talk will also cover the event &ldquo;Inside_out&rdquo; (June 27 - 28, 2003), an MFA Thesis show by Marientina Gotsis that featured the Anatomical Theatre at UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory. This recent event was an experiment, created as a tribute to a relationship that is neither new nor a fad.<br><br>
