Drew Browning and collaborator Annette Barbier have individual works in a site specific venue associated with the conference called VIBE: Video in the Built Environment. V.I.B.E. is an artist-led project that explores the impact of media in the built environment through curated site-specific interventions, presentations and published documentation.<br><br>

Browning&rsquo;s video piece, &ldquo;Homeland Insecurity&rdquo;, will show in the windows of 600 S. Michigan, as will Barbier&rsquo;s &ldquo;Homeland Security Advice&rdquo;. Both these pieces are responses to the current threatening climate we all live in. VIBE is collaborating with Cornerhouse Gallery in Manchester, UK to exchange video collections and screen them in public venues in Chicago, Manchester and Liverpool U.K.<br><br>

Also part of VIBE are several experimental outdoor works showing at the intersection of 11th Avenue and Wabash. These pieces will only be up on August 2nd, 8:30 - 10:00pm, when Browning will be showing, &ldquo;Preserving Disorder&rdquo;, an interactive sidewalk projection, recalling the images and dynamics of the summer of &rsquo;68 in Chicago. Barbier will also have an outdoor projected piece called, &ldquo;Escape&rdquo;, on a building in the same area.<br><br>
