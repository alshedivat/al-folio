<strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, September 24, 2013<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 6:00pm<br><br>

UIC computer science PhD student and EVL research assistant Victor Mateevitsi is presenting his work on SpiderSense as part of the Chicago Public Library (CPL) Innovation Lab Program. SpiderSense is a UIC prototype wearable suit that enables users to sense (without seeing) obstacles around them. Like the comic book character Spider-Man, whose skin tingles at approaching danger, SpiderSense augments human ability - it can potentially help a pedestrian &lsquo;see&rsquo; hidden dangers, help a fireman entering smoke-filled buildings, or help a visually impaired person navigate his environment. SpiderSense consists of sensor modules, strategically placed on the wearer&rsquo;s body, and uses ultrasound to scan the environment for obstacles within 60 feet which it then translates into tactile signals that stimulate the wearer&rsquo;s skin. Victor Mateevitsi developed SpiderSense as a class project with fellow UIC students Brad Haggadone and Brian Kunzer, under the direction of professors Jason Leigh and Robert Kenyon. Seating for the CPL SpiderSense event is available first come, first served, and reservations are not required.
