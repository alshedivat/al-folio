EVLers participated in the 3rd annual <em>GeoWall</em> meeting leading sessions focusing on Education using the <em>GeoWall</em> system, and the future of the <em>GeoWall</em> hardware, software, applications, and collaborations. The focus of the meeting is &ldquo;Learning and Teaching about the Earth with the <em>GeoWall</em>&rdquo;.<br><br>

As part of the event, the <em>GeoWall</em> was used for orientation / briefing prior to a group excursion to explore a number of geologically significant sites located in Arizona. This practical use of the <em>GeoWall</em> exemplified a typical classroom field trip session for meeting participants.
