<a href="http://resumbrae.com">resumbrae.com</a><br><br>

Assistant Professor in the Department of Media Study of the University at Buffalo, Dave received a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he worked at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL). At EVL, he was responsible for much of the core software used by the CAVE and ImmersaDesk developers. Prior to that, he worked at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, in the Scientific Visualization Studio and the High Performance Computing &amp; Communications branch. Dave has created many videos and interactive VR environments that have been shown at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry, the Ars Electronica Center, and conferences including SIGGRAPH, Supercomputing, ISEA, Ars Electronica, Art Futura, and ThinkQuest.<br><br>

<strong>Topics / Questions:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>What stimulated you to work on virtual reality software development for artists and museums, and also custom visualization production?</li>
<li>What were the main reasons / factors which  conducted you to work in the design of software such us XPn (an Authoring System for Immersive Art Exhibitions, presently known as the Ygdrasil system), which among other features, allow artists to create the final environment by assembling the appropriate pieces?</li>
<li>The most interesting and challenging work you have done as a scientist and software developer in the art field: Which ones, why, what did you learn from this?</li>
<li>What do you advise to an artist who is working in the VR field: What are the most important things for an artist to know &ldquo;before&rdquo; and &ldquo;after&rdquo; they get involved in the Virtual productions?</li>
<li>Can a VR artist (not professional computer and or graphics programmers) become completely autonomous / independent as producers. Or will programmers and software developers always be needed?</li>
<li>Can you extend the concept and solutions of &ldquo;How to produce low-cost VR solutions&rdquo;?</li>
<li>Your opinion about the actual market tendency for Virtual Art</li>
</ul><br>

Josephine Anstey is a virtual dramatist, virtual reality (VR) artist, video-maker, documentarian and writer. She is primarily interested in creating interactive, dramatic experiences for display on projected, immersive VR systems (such as the CAVE&reg;). A related area of interest is research into low-cost VR systems and networked VR. Her other projects include interactive installations, art videos, audio documentary, web and prose fiction.Since 2000 she has been on the faculty of the media study department of the University at Buffalo (UB), where she teaches production and analysis courses focusing on virtual reality and interactive environments. Master of Fine Arts in Electronic Visualization, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), 2000<br><br>

<strong>Topics / Questions</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Experience as students in EVL: how and what was useful for you while studying here?</li>
<li>Goals and accomplishments since you concluded your studies: What have you done and what are you actually doing now?</li>
<li>Major difficulties, if there were any, you have faced in the professional world and eventually how did you overcome it?</li>
<li>Critical analysis of the path that goes from being a &ldquo;student&rdquo; to become an active professional in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world</li>
<li>About your virtual reality art works and research projects related to interactive drama in VR: concepts, motivations, goals, production process, implementation</li>
<li>Your involvement in research related to low-cost VR solutions</li>
<li>About the Low Cost VR System you have created for the Department of Media Study, UB, to direct the creation of VR art projects by UB Students: vision, goals, accomplishment, and strategy</li>
