We are organising a workshop at the ECPR Joint Sessions of Workshops with [Fred Paxton](https://fredpaxton.com){:target="_blank"} on [Movement Parties: their rise, variety, and consequences](https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PanelDetails/11354){:target="_blank"}. The workshop is scheduled to take place between the 19<sup>th</sup> and the 22<sup>nd</sup> of April 2022, at the University of Edinburgh, hopefully face-to-face. If you are working on the topic, hand in your application on the [ECPR platform](https://ecpr.eu/JointSessions){:target="_blank"} by the 2<sup>nd</sup> of February!
