Three UIC faculty members, including Professor Daria Tsoupikova and Assistant Professor Fabio Miranda from UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), and the School of Design&rsquo;s Professor Sharon Oiga, can see their work on display nightly, as part of a larger-than-life public art installation downtown - <a href="https://artonthemart.com/chicago-design-through-the-decades/">Art on theMART</a>.<br><br>
The display referred to as <i>Chicago Design Through the Decades</i> is a journey through the last hundred years of the history of Chicago design and is based on the collection of the <a href="https://chicagodesignarchive.org/">Chicago Design Archive (CDA)</a>, a permanent online record of design in the city.  The historical imagery is assembled using machine learning algorithms provided by Miranda, which is a tribute to Chicago as the home of neural networks.  The final imagery is projected across the Chicago River onto the Merchandise Mart for a spectacular digital art experience.  The display runs through December 30th nightly at 7:30 p.m. and 8 p.m.<br><br>
Stay tuned for the possibility of student collaboration on another Art on theMART display or similar public digital art project given the new undergraduate <a href="https://cs.uic.edu/undergraduate/cs-and-design/">CS + Design</a> major, which debuted Fall 2022.  UIC is the only public university that currently offers this degree, and prospects are bright for students to participate in innovative digital art projects such as <i>Chicago Design Through the Decades</i> in the future.<br><br>
