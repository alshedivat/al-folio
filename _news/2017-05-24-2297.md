May 25, 2017 marks the 40th anniversary of the theatrical release of the first &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; movie. To celebrate the occasion, and to highlight Chicago&rsquo;s unique connection to the film, the Chicago Tribune published an in-depth and thoughtful article by features writer Chris Borrelli on May 23, 2017, titled &ldquo;Blueprints for &lsquo;Star Wars&rsquo; Death Star were created at UIC.&rdquo; <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-star-wars-evl-lab-ent-0524-20170523-column.html"> See the Tribune article.</a><br><br>

Borrelli writes that the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) &ldquo;has a small but curious cameo in the first &lsquo;Star Wars&rsquo; movie - the Death Star battle plans that are presented were created there, by a small group of programmers and animators in 1976&rdquo; (for the film&rsquo;s release in 1977).<br><br>
At that time, traditional special effects were primarily done using optical (photographic) and mechanical (physical) techniques; computer generated imagery was in its infancy. The &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; movie&rsquo;s special effects were done traditionally, except for one brief scene - a computer model of the Death Star that is viewed by the Rebel Alliance in their briefing room as they try to determine the best way to destroy it.<br><br>
California artist Larry Cuba wanted to bid on the computer graphics, but commercial software was either non-existent or proprietary, and hardware was expensive. So, Cuba approached Tom DeFanti, a computer graphics pioneer, computer science professor and co-founder of EVL, and asked to use lab&rsquo;s hardware and software to create the film&rsquo;s content.<br><br>
Though the scene took months to generate, its legacy has lasted decades. &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; came out years before Lucas created Industrial Light &amp; Magic, and years before he created its precursor, the Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Research Group, which ultimately became Pixar.<br><br>
DeFanti, interviewed for this article, says &ldquo;And now, [Star Wars] is the story of my life, this pleasant thread. Whenever I give a lecture, no matter what it&rsquo;s about, I&rsquo;m someone who worked on &lsquo;Star Wars.&rsquo; I mean, who would have thought, in 1977, of all the things developed at the lab in Chicago, the one small piece of a film we contributed to, a movie none of us expected to be significant, would help fund a lot of people to do a lot of (computer animation).&rdquo;<br><br>
Maxine Brown, current EVL director, is proud of the lab&rsquo;s role in the movie. &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;but it can date you - when they suggest that the last thing you did was develop the Death Star.&rdquo; And, Cuba, a computer art pioneer, states, &ldquo;I make experimental computer-animated films…There are maybe 1,000 people familiar with my films and 10 billion who know the other thing.&rdquo;<br><br>
Steve Heminover, who worked at EVL as a UIC undergraduate when Larry Cuba was there, was able to keep the computer graphics hardware, software and associated data files from the scrap heap as the equipment aged - and, more serendipitously, was able to restore and make it operational. This article contains a video clip by Tribune photographer Chris Sweda, in which Heminover demonstrates the working computer system. And, as the Death Star&rsquo;s blueprints rotate on the old vector display, Heminover plays the briefing room scene from the original movie on his smartphone in the foreground.<br><br>
May the Force continue!<br><br>

In Spring 2015, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of UIC, the Alumni magazine published the article &ldquo;The Circle&rdquo; by Daniel P. Smith that highlights 50 moments in the history of the campus. Number 49 on the list is the &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; imagery created by UIC/EVL.<br>

Steve Heminover is a recipient of the 2007 UIC Alumni Association&rsquo;s Achievement Award for his pioneering contributions to the growth of the laser display industry.<br>
