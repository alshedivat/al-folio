The Electronic Visualization Laboratory does many tours, demos and presentations to assist the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) College of Engineering with minority education and recruitment programs. On June 18, 2010, EVL hosted a teacher and several of his students from Chicago&rsquo;s Austin Polytechnic High School as part of the University of Illinois Affiliate Project Lead The Way (PLTW) program. This PLTW trip was organized by Dr. Wally Goncharoff of the UIC College of Engineering. After the tour and discussions, the teacher sent an email to Dr. Goncharoff saying, &ldquo;&hellip;the effect of your tour on their imaginations and positive conception of UIC cannot be overstated.&rdquo;<br><br>
