We have been awarded an [Alberta Innovates Advance, Stream II](https://albertainnovates.ca/programs/advance/)/[NSERC Alliance](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/innovate-innover/alliance-alliance/index_eng.asp) grant for our research project investigating learning structure in neural networks for novel data domains over the next two years. Alberta Innovates Advance invests in projects that, in alignment with Alberta’s technology and innovation strategies, advance discoveries to develop emerging technologies which can generate economic, environmental, health and social benefits for Albertans and Canadians.
