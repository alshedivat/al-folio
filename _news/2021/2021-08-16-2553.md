The IBHE has approved the request for a Bachelor&rsquo;s of Science (BS) degree in both Computer Science and Design effective for the Fall 2022 admissions and course cycle.  This interdisciplinary degree officially culminates in EVL&rsquo;s long standing mission to support collaborative work between artists, scientist, engineers and technologists  going back over 40 years.  Electronic visualization and electronic art design have been the foundation of EVL&rsquo;s work since its inception in 1973, established by founding co-directors Tom DeFanti and Dan Sandin.<br><br>
We are extremely pleased for UIC to offer an official BS in CS and Design.
