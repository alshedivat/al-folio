## Deep Umbra: A Global-Scale Generative Adversarial Approach for Sunlight Access and Shadow Accumulation in Urban Spaces



![image](/images/deepumbra.png-srcw.jpg){:style="max-width: 100%"}

Deep Umbra is a novel computational framework that enables the quantification of sunlight access and shadows at a global scale.  Our framework is based on a conditional generative adversarial network that considers the physical form of cities to compute high-resolution spatial information of accumulated shadow cast for the different seasons of the year.<br><br>
Deep Umbra&rsquo;s primary motivation is the impact that shadow management can have on people&rsquo;s quality of life, since it can affect levels of comfort, heat distribution, public parks, etc.  We also present the Global Shadow Dataset, a comprehensive dataset with the accumulated shadow information for over 100 cities on 6 continents.<br><br>
A <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/shadows/map">webviewer</a> has been developed to visualize accumulated shadow cast over a specific geographic area.  The map shows the accumulated shadow for three different days of the year - Summer, Spring/Fall, and Winter.
