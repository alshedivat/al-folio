PRAGMA is hosting a Zoom-based SAGE3 presentation and live demonstration by SAGE3 Principal Investigator (PI) Jason Leigh and co-PI Luc Renambot as well as other SAGE3 Team members. In addition, SAGE2 users Prapaporn (Nan) Rattanatamrong of Thammasat University in Thailand and Jason Haga of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Japan start the presentation with several ongoing SAGE2 use cases.<br><br>
This presentation is part of the 2021 Re-Connect Webinar series organized by the PRAGMA (Pacific Rim Application and Grid Middleware Assembly) organization. Many PRAGMA members are long-time SAGE users.<br><br>
Since receiving an NSF award for SAGE3, the Smart Amplified Group Environment, in May 2020, the SAGE3 Team has been hard at work designing and developing SAGE3. An alpha version of the SAGE3 remote collaboration platform is being presented.<br><br> 
SAGE3 is being designed to integrate AI technologies with applications, visualization workflows and collaboration services. SAGE3 takes advantage of major technological and sociological changes that have occurred since SAGE2 was introduced in 2013. Notably, web browsers and languages are maturing; scientific communities are relying on notebooks; science workloads incorporate AI programs and programmable infrastructure; and, given the pandemic, the workplace is changing to hybrid office/home environments that require not just video-teleconferencing but data-driven tools for largely distributed groups.<br><br>
All are welcome to attend! No pre-registration is required.<br><br>

The SAGE3 presentation and demonstration were first done for the CineGrid organization in June 2021. However, if you were unable to see it then, we urge you to tune into the PRAGMA webinar and then ask questions of SAGE3 Team members. This presentation will be recorded and available at a later date.<br><br>
