It is an immersive play that was the brainchild of Daria Tsoupikova, professor in the school of design, Jo Cattell, an award-winning theater director, and members of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), including Andrew Johnson, interim director and director of research.<br><br>
Workshop performances of &ldquo;Hummingbird&rdquo; were held at EVL June 18th through the 20th with a theatrical premiere planned for this coming fall.
