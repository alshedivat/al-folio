For the last several years EVL faculty member and CS associate professor Liz Marai has been collaborating with the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and the University of Iowa to develop tools to help oncologists make better assessments for treating cancer patients.  More recently, Liz Marai and co-investigator Xinhua Zhang also from UIC have been developing a scalable artificial intelligence system based on real patient data to serve as a decision support tool for physicians treating head and neck cancer patients.  This research is funded by the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute Award #3R01CA258827-01S1, entitled &ldquo;Longitudinal Spatial-Nonspatial Decision Support for Competing Outcomes in Head and Neck Cancer Therapy&rdquo; with principal investigators from UIC, the University of Texas, and the University of Iowa.<br><br>
