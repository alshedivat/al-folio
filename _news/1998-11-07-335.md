The &ldquo;International Grid&rdquo; (iGrid) research booth at Supercomputing &rsquo;98 was a collaboration between the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Indiana University (IU) to showcase global research community networking.<br><br>

Booth connectivity to STAR TAP&#8480; via the vBNS enabled participating researchers to interact with colleagues worldwide in order to demonstrate a variety of applications - manufacturing, health care, education, environmental studies, and computational science and engineering - which utilize such technological advancements as distributed computing, tele-immersion, large datasets, remote instrumentation, and collaboration.<br><br>

EVL demonstrated CAVERNsoft Tele-Immersive Collaborations between Singapore, Australia, Japan, and the United States through the iGrid.
