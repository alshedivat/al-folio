Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) researchers are awarded a supplemental subaward from the University of Hawaii to contribute to the research on &ldquo;SI2-SSI: SAGEnext: Next Generation Integrated Persistent Visualization and Collaboration Services for Global Cyberinfrastructure&rdquo;. The UIC lead on this project is Maxine Brown, director of EVL. Other UIC participants include Computer Science Research Associate Professor Luc Renambot, Senior Research Programmer Lance Long, and Associate Professor Andy Johnson, Research Director of the EVL.<br><br>
This new funding is part of a $527,000 supplement to the overall SAGE2 software project, with PI Jason Leigh at University of Hawaii. The supplement brings the overall project funding to roughly $5.5 million, with roughly 20% at the University of Hawaii and 80% at UIC.<br><br>
The overall project is for the SAGE2 software that allows groups to collaborate on large, multi-screen devices such as EVL&rsquo;s CAVE2&trade;. This new supplement is for the research team to consider the cybersecurity of SAGE2, in this era when cybersecurity is of such paramount importance.<br><br>
NSF Award ID:  OAC-1441963<br>
Project Period: 10/1/18-9/30/19<br>
Award Amount:  $386,000
The SAGE2 team at UIC/EVL remotely collaborated with the University of Chicagoâ€™s Research Computing Center during its fourth annual research computing symposium and exposition, Mind Bytes.
