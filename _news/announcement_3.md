I’m excited to share that I have successfully passed my Ph.D. thesis proposal exam and am now officially a Ph.D. candidate!

I’m deeply grateful to my advisor, Dr. P. Douglas Yoder, as well as my family members, and colleagues for their guidance and support throughout this journey. This milestone brings me one step closer to the finish line, and I’m looking forward to the work ahead.
