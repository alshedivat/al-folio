The first Creative Coding Community Workshop brought together a diverse group of Chicago public high school students ranging in age from 13 to 15 to introduce students to the basics of coding, interactive 3D, typography and game design.  Hosted at the University of Illinois Chicago&rsquo;s (UIC), Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) and organized by professor Daria Tsoupikova, participating students productively conquered a steep learning curve to learn the basics of coding, - starting from ground zero to produce interactive Virtual Reality (VR) projects for a public exhibition â€“ all within 2 weeks!  Their projects investigated critical global concepts such as global warming, air and water pollution, migration, and mental health in immersive dimensions of Computer Science + Design.  Several projects were featured in the CAVE2 Hybrid Reality Environment VR exhibition after the Workshop.  The Workshop was a tremendous success and very well received by participants and organizers.<br><br>
Congratulations to all participants and good luck with your future pursuits in Computer Science and Design!<br><br>
