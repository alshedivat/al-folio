EVL alumnae Helen-Nicole Kostis and Cole Krumbholz join Daria Tsoupikova, EVL Associate Professor to curate two new panels on Scientific and BioMedical Visualization for the SIGGRAPH 2009 Computer Animation Festival. These panels showcased exciting recent visualization works in both 2D and 3D Stereoscopic formats to capture interesting or under-represented areas in Visualization, and to contribute to the definition of the standards for technical development and production methods.<br><br>

<em>Tomorrow&rsquo;s Yesterday: Scientific and BioMedical Visualization</em><br>

<a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2009/sessions/panels/details/?type=panel&amp;id=137">S2009 Panel Description</a><br>
Screenings of state-of-the art scientific and biomedical visualizations followed by discussions of innovative solutions, behind-the-scenes software developments, interdisciplinary collaboration, methods, techniques, and production pipelines. The goal of this panel is to present fresh work, capture interesting and under-represented visualization areas in the SIGGRAPH community, and contribute to definition of standards for technical development and production methods. The panel provides a balanced platform for exploration of the overlapping technical problems and complex solutions in scientific and biomedical visualizations knowledge.<br><br>
