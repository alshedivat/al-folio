OCTOBER 15, 2018 - &ldquo;Chicago New Media 1973-1992&rdquo; is a public exhibition, to be held November 1 - December 15, 2018, that illuminates the largely untold story of Chicago&rsquo;s computer-based art and design legacy, and provides new historical understanding of the artists and organizations that contributed to digital art and technology in the latter half of the 20th Century. The Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is prominently featured. The exhibition spans the dates EVL was founded (1973) as a joint effort of the UIC Computer Science (CS) department and the School of Art and Design, through EVL&rsquo;s introduction of the CAVE&trade; automatic virtual environment (1992).<br><br>
