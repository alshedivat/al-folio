EVL doctoral candidate, Javier Girado presents the findings of his latest research in face detection at the IS&amp;T / SPIE&rsquo;s 15th Annual Symposium Electronic Imaging 2003.<br><br>

The goal of this research is the development of a robust video-based, tetherless 3D head position and orientation tracking system. The work is specifically targeted for auto-stereoscopic displays and projection-based virtual reality systems. The proposed face detector is based on a modified LAMSTAR neural network system.
