## Sayre Glove (first wired data glove)


The Sayre Glove was developed by Richard Sayre, Dan Sandin and Tom DeFanti in 1976 for use with the GRASS system. The black tubes are the angle transducers which register how much each joint is bent.

In 1977 Daniel J. Sandin and Thomas DeFanti created the first wired data glove based on an idea by Richard Sayre as a project for the National Endowment for the Arts.  It used light based sensors with flexible tubes with a light source at one end and a photocell at the other.  As the fingers were bent, the amount of light that hit the photocells varied, thus providing a measure of finger flexion.  It was a lightweight, inexpensive effective method for multidimensional control, mainly used to manipulate sliders.<br><br>
