ThinkQuest is an annual contest that challenges Students 12 - 19 to use the Internet as a collaborative, interactive teaching and learning tool.<br><br>

EVL students and faculty demonstrated three collaborative VR projects networked between two ImmersaDesks - one in Washington at the conference site and one at EVL:
<ul>
<li>The N.I.C.E. Project, a collaborative learning environment for children.</li>
<li>Virtual Temporal Bone, an educational medical application.</li>
<li>4-D Math, an educational application in mathematics.</li>
</ul><br>

Three stand-alone art and culture projects were also exhibited  - Mitologies, Las Meninas and Strait Dope.
