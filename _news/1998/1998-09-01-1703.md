Twenty years ago, Ken Knowlton created a see-through display for Bell Labs using a half-silvered mirror mounted at an angle in front of a telephone operator.<br><br>

The monitor driving the display was positioned above the desk facing down so that its image of a virtual keyboard could be superimposed on the operator&rsquo;s hands working under the mirror. The keycaps on the operator&rsquo;s physical keyboard could be dynamically relabeled to match the task of completing a call as it progressed.<br><br>

Devices that align computer imagery with the user&rsquo;s viewable environment, like Knowlton&rsquo;s, are examples of augmented reality, or see-through VR.<br><br>

More recently, researchers at the National University of Singapore&rsquo;s Institute of Systems Science built a stereo device of similar plan using a Silicon Graphics&rsquo; monitor, a well-executed configuration for working with small parts in high-resolution VR.<br><br>

Neither of these systems provides tracking, but rather assumes the user to be in a fixed and seated position.<br><br>

EVL is using projection technology to prototype PARIS&trade;, a third-generation version of this concept, optimized to allow users to interact with the environment using their hands or a variety of input devices such as - haptic (touch) displays like the Phantom and force-feedback gloves.<br><br>

The PARIS&trade; display has excellent contrast and variable lighting which allows hands to be seen immersed in the imagery. The current PARIS&trade; production prototype employs the Christie Mirage 2000 DLP projector and a double mirror-fold to compactly and brightly illuminate the overhead black screen.<br><br>

This configuration is well suited to the lighting conditions of a typical office environment. The device can be easily packed, moved and deployed.<br><br>

New modalities (such as vision, speech and gesture) are being explored as human-computer interfaces for the PARIS&trade; system.<br><br>

Gesture recognition can come from either tracking the user&rsquo;s movements or processing them using video camera input. Gaze direction, or eye tracking, using camera input is also possible.<br><br>

Audio support can be used for voice recognition and generation, as well as used in conjunction with recording tele-immersive sessions.<br><br>

Used together, these systems enable tether-less tracking and unencumbered hand movements for improved augmented reality interaction.<br><br>

PARIS uses EVL-developed collaboration and networking software CAVERNsoft and Quanta, which enable real-time interactions over very-high-speed networks. CAVERNsoft and Quanta run under Irix, Linux and Win9x/NT/2000.<br><br>
