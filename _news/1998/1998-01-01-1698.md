Interiors is conceived and directed by Margaret Dolinsky, premiering at SIGGRAPH 98&rsquo;s Enhanced Realities Exhibition. &ldquo;Interiors&rdquo; continues Dolinsky&rsquo;s exploration in the stream of consciousness movement that characterizes her VR.<br><br>

Interiors is a CAVE&trade; virtual reality art experience that includes networking, live video, and sound activated graphics. Participants explore and actively ignite events to gain a new knowledge base through exploration and perceptual interaction. Events are triggered by the participants&rsquo; approach to an object. Proximity, waving the navigation wand, or whispers and shouts causes the environment to react and demand reaction. The CG characters are activated by the music, dancing to its rhythms and beats.
