<a href="http://www.ntt.co.jp/index.html">NTT</a> researchers visit to implement MediaCruising. MediaCruising is a prototype advanced networking protocol optimized for streaming media and bulk data transfer over next generation IP infrastructure. This is the first phase of N*Vector, a three-way joint research project in advanced networking and tele-immersion between the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at University of Illinois at Chicago, NTT Optical Network Systems Laboratory in Yokosuka, Japan, and the Intelligent Modeling Laboratory at the University of Tokyo.<br><br>

The first applications to be prototyped include high performance videoconferencing using MPEG-2, and remotely controlled Super High Definition image capture, transmission, and display. These applications will be implemented over GEMnet, NTT&rsquo;s global research network linking Chicago and Tokyo.
