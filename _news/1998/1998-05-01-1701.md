The ImmersaDesk3&trade; is an experiment in desktop VR using a flat panel display. Our goal was to make a prototype with tracking and stereo for SIGGRAPH 98, where the I-Desk3&trade; was the roving part of EVL&rsquo;s Guerilla VR installation.<br><br>

Guerilla VR consisted of two ImmersaDesks&trade; showing seven art and educational VR pieces. Four applications were networked between the two IDesks; Dimension World, Interiors, The Round Earth Project and The Thing Growing. An IDesk2&trade; remained at the Digital Pavilions area in the Emerging Technologies section on the SIGGRAPH conference floor, while an IDesk3 roamed to different locations.<br><br>


The IDesk3&trade; was built around a Fujitsu 42 inch diagonal plasma panel. Because of limitations in the plasma display we had to use a NTSC based signal at a resolution of 640 x 480 with a 60hz refresh rate. To run stereo on this display we had to develop an unconventional method since the plasma display emitted infra-red in the same spectrum usually used to trigger the active stereo glasses.<br><br>

In order to solve this problem we developed a driver that would run the glasses via wire, and the sync acquisition was accomplished with a high speed photo-cell mounted directly onto the plasma display. However, at this time there are still stereo problems with the plasma panel that can only be resolved by the manufacturer.<br><br>

Due to these hardware constraints, further research in the development of VR devices using flat panel technology as the display mechanism is currently postponed.
