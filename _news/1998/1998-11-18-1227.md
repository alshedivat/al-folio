CAVERNsoft is an architecture for creating Tele-Immersive applications, with the goal of making synchronous and asynchronous trans-oceanic collaboration a routine matter. This paper briefly discusses CAVERNsoft and then discusses several applications that have been built using CAVERNsoft with a focus on those with trans-oceanic concepts.
