This &ldquo;Late Breaking Hot Topic Paper&rdquo; describes the LIMBO / VTK a tool that allows developers to quickly build collaborative visualization applications for CAVE, ImmersaDesk as well as desktop workstations. LIMBO / VTK is based on two broadly used technologies: CAVERNsoft, a library for supporting collaborative Virtual Reality, and the Visualization Toolkit, an extensive library for supporting 3D graphics and visualization.
