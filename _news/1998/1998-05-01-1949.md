Rave Culture is a short documentary film about the culture, scene, and experiences that revolve around a rave party. Shot on location at six Chicago parties over the course of a year, this film explores multiple issues surrounding the rave scene, including public opinion, promoters, drugs, police, and the culture created by this phenomenon.
