CAVERN, the CAVE&trade; Research Network, is an alliance of industrial and research institutions equipped with CAVE&trade;-based virtual reality hardware and high-performance computing resources, interconnected by high-speed networks, to support collaboration in design, education, engineering, computational steering and scientific visualization.<br><br>

CAVERNsoft is the collaborative software backbone for CAVERN. CAVERNsoft uses distributed data stores to manage the wide range of data volumes (from a few bytes to several terabytes) that are typically needed for sustaining collaborative virtual environments.<br><br>

Multiple networking interfaces support customizable, latency, data consistency, and scalability that are needed to support a broad spectrum of networking requirements. These diverse database and networking requirements are characteristics typically unexhibited by previous desktop multimedia systems but are common in real-time immersive virtual reality applications.<br><br>

Networking support is provided by Argonne National Lab&rsquo;s <em>Globus</em>.
