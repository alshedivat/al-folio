EVL&rsquo;s participation in SIGGRAPH 98 included virtual reality demonstrations using an ImmersaDesk2 in the &ldquo;Guerilla VR&rdquo; venue at the Digital Pavilions (Emerging Technologies) and a roving ImmersaDesk3 throughout the Conference venues.<br><br>

Four of the art and education VR applications were networked between the two IDesks; &ldquo;Dimension World&rdquo;, &ldquo;Interiors&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Round Earth Project&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Thing Growing&rdquo;.<br><br>

Three applications were stand-alone; &ldquo;Grid&rdquo;, &ldquo;Las Meninas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mitologies&rdquo;.<br><br>

The pieces showed a variety of methods for creating interactive VR work.<br><br>

<strong>EVLers also took part in the following events:</strong>
