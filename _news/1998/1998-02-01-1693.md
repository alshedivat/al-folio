Grey is a black and white computer generated and animated short film. It is loosely based on &ldquo;The Good Samaritan&rdquo; storyline (Luke 10:29-37 NIV) from the New Testament section of the Bible.<br><br>

Grey adheres to the parable only somewhat as it takes it&rsquo;s overlying plot line from the scriptures. The characters of the rich man, the religious man, and the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; are all represented.<br><br>

The story strays from the victim, to the enemy. We see the evolution of the samaritan from a reluctant gang member into reluctant hero.<br><br>

Whether the term hero can be aptly given to the character is one that the audience must question.
