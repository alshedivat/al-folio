The ImmersaDesk2, designed and developed at EVL, is a roadworthy (air cargo qualified) version of the ImmersaDesk.   With the press of a button, this &lsquo;Desk&rsquo; will instantly transform to vertical screen position for use as a  rear projection display. This self-contained flight case features a rapidly deployable rear projection system optimized as a sloped screen Spatially Immersive Display [SID] and includes onboard tracking, audio and input device equipment. Graphic system not included.<br><br>

The ImmersaDesk2 in its prototype form was tested at a good number of exhibitions (Fall 1997) ISEA &rsquo;97, Internet 2, ThinkQuest &rsquo;97 and Supercomupting &rsquo;97 conferences. The production unit is currently available from <a href="http://www.fakespacesystems.com/">FakeSpace Systems</a> as a ImmersaDesk R2.
