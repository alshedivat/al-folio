An MFA thesis project, the &ldquo;City of Brass&rdquo; (Adapted from &ldquo;A Thousand Nights and One Night&rdquo;) is a film by Hisham Bizri and Alan Cruz&hellip;<br><br>

Antoine Galland&rsquo;s Apartment Late Afternoon (FRANCE, 18th. C.)<br><br>

A hand holding a feathered pen writes on a desk the following words. &ldquo;We made preparations for four months and traveled in the desert of Al-Andalus. We tried to arrive at the city which nobody had ever heard of and we traveled for 43 days.&rdquo;<br><br>

The hands stops writing for a second but then resumes and we hear the voice of a man reading the words: &ldquo;Finally, we saw the city&rsquo;s battlements shining out at a distance of five days&rsquo; journey. The sight frightened us.&rdquo;<br><br>

The voice of woman whispering the following words is juxtaposed over the voice of the man: &ldquo;and filled our hearts with fear. When we arrived at the wall its form was amazingly terrible and its aspect fearful and horror-inspiring like nothing else in creation. We dismounted and said the evening prayers.&rdquo;
