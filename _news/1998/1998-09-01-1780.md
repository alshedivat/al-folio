CAVERNsoft is a C++ toolkit for building collaborative networked applications or logistical networking applications. It has low and mid level networking classes to support general collaborative application building, and it has higher level modules to specifically support Tele-Immersion (or collaborative virtual reality.)<br><br>

CAVERNsoft capabilities work across SGI, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and Win32 (Windows 9x, NT, 2000) platforms.
