This project seeks to expedite the creation of more compelling collaborative VR applications using either the CAVE or Immersadesk VR display devices. Tandem is a Distributed Interaction Framework for Collaborative VR applications. It makes use of the CAVElib for VR projection display support, and CAVERNsoft for its networking. Its strategic use of object technology such as STL and Design Patterns enables an architecure that exploits existing patterns in Collaborative VR. This framework allows VR developers to spend more time developing the application content and less time implementing generic VR requirements.
