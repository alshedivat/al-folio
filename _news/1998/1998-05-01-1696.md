The CAVE&trade; Tools class is a group of virtual input controls that can be used in the CAVE&trade; Virtual environment.<br><br>

They consist of three independent classes, a sliding knob, a rotating knob and a button. All classes return a value of zero to one. All three classes are available and can be called individually by invoking the tool name&rsquo;s header and object file.
