&ldquo;The proposed approach involves video taping a scene twice with a hand-held video camera. Each time the recording is performed under different lighting conditions&hellip; From the first pass a coarse 3D geometry of the scene is obtained with an associated texture. During the second pass a detailed 3D geometry is obtained but without a texture. Information from these two passes are combined in order to obtain detailed 3D geomtry and texture.&rdquo;<br><br>
