The UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) has six years of experience building first and second-generation virtual reality devices (the CAVE in 1991 and the ImmersaDesk in 1995) to support tele-immersion applications, and is now conducting research in third-generation virtual reality devices to construct, as best as possible, variable resolution and desktop / office-sized displays.<br><br>

Since no current technology is yet configurable with ideal resolution and size, EVL will first simulate these devices with available parts, and then build more advanced prototypes.<br><br>

This grant provides equipment funds to buy, evaluate, and integrate a variety of emerging display devices, such as large color plasma displays, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) projectors, Light Emitting Diode (LED) panels, Ferro-electric Liquid Crystal (FLC) displays, and Digital Micro Mirror Displays (DMD).<br><br>

EVL will also adopt latest generation graphics engines on both Unix and NT-based graphics platforms in order to reach and service the largest possible scientific and engineering user base.<br><br>

The goal of this research is to develop clearly compelling prototypes so that these devices can be improved and reproduced by the private sector.
