Our student [Anubha Mahajan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anubha-mahajan-570035227/) showcased her teams' work this week at the Sustainability Showcase at the Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems.

She and her team are currently working on a surrogate model of urban building energy simulation. They will document their contributions on our [VIP wiki](https://vip-smur.github.io/wiki/) later this semester.
