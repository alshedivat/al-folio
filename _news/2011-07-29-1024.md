<em>The Fall Beyond Tomorrow&rsquo;s Life</em> was shown as part of the show <a href="http://milwaukeeavenueartsfestival.org">Incomplete Sense for the 2011 Milwaukee Avenue Arts Festival</a>. This exhibition set out to explore the spectrum of sensory input, and the impact is has on our understanding of reality. More specifically, how does the impairment, interference, or misunderstanding of a stream of sensory information affect a person&rsquo;s understanding of the world? Perception, cognition, and consciousness are intrinsically linked.
