Sunday, January 26, 2014, the New York Times had a blog / story entitled &ldquo;Disruptions: The Holodeck Begins to Take Shape,&rdquo; by journalist Nick Bilton.<br><br>

The Holodeck was introduced on the TV series &ldquo;StarTrek: The Next Generation.&rdquo; The article goes on to say:<br><br>

&ldquo;While the show is set in the future, some scientists and researchers say we could have something like holodecks by 2024. If you have enough money, you could even buy one today, though it would be crude compared to the holodecks on Star Trek. This is all part of a quest by computer companies, Hollywood and video game makers to move entertainment closer to reality - or at least a computer-generated version of reality. Rather than simply watch movies, the thinking goes, we could become part of the story.&rdquo;<br><br>

The article then talks about Holodeck variations built by AMD, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Microsoft and Microsoft Research.<br><br>

Finally, it mentions UIC, citing an article and video produced by Associated Press in 2013:<br><br>

&ldquo;Last year researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago created a version of a holodeck called CAVE2, with funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. CAVE2 uses eight-foot high screens that cover 320 degrees of a room and can be used to model global weather patterns, study the way new drugs work in the body and help doctors practice surgeries.&rdquo;<br><br>
