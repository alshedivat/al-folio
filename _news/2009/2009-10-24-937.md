October 30, 2009 - Teaching doctors about eye diseases using stereoscopic computer-graphics imaging was well received at this week&rsquo;s <a href="http://aao.org">American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) annual conference</a>, held in San Francisco. UIC&rsquo;s Department of Pharmacy Practice (PHARM) and Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) developed a well-attended instruction course entitled &ldquo;Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Mimicking Macular Lesions - A Unique Stereoscopic Adventure.&rdquo; Using a commercially available passive-stereo 3D display, the audience was able to examine 3D images of the fundus of AMD patients and compare and contrast them with people with mimicking lesions, thereby learning how to more accurately diagnose AMD and distinguish it from other diseases. PHARM&rsquo;s Rick Fiscella and EVL&rsquo;s Luc Renambot developed the applications and designed the course using images from doctors at UIC, UCLA, Cornell, University of Florida, and University of Hong Kong.
