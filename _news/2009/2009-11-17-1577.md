This document outlines the research, implementation, and aesthetic philosophies of <em>Meridianus Divinitus</em>. <em>Meridianus Divinitus</em> is an artistic reinterpretation of the body energetic. It was created by taking data from existing charts which outline the flows of chi through out the human body for use in training acupuncture and acupressure, augmented by personal impressions attained by tactile remote sensing. This information was used to create a system of rules for particle creation and flow. Simple sets of spatial locations were artistically interpreted into five separate video animations, based loosely on the ancient five &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; elements (in Western cultures): fire, water, air, earth, and spirit. These works culminated in a four-channel gallery installation, juxtaposing four animations of archetypal classic elements projected in the four cardinal directions.
