ParaView is one of the most widely used scientific tools that supports parallel visualization of large scale data. The Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment (SAGE) is a graphics middleware that enables real-time streaming of ultra-high resolution visual content from distributed visualization resources to scalable tiled displays connected by ultra-high-speed networks. Integrating these two technologies enables visualization of large-scale data at an extremely high resolution to be displayed on distantly located scalable tiled displays. The benefits, limitations, and future directions for this approach will be discussed.<br><br>
