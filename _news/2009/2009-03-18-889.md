Paige Treebridge, MFA Electronic Visualization candidate, will present <em>Dog Days</em>, an experimental theater performance incorporating live theater, iPod-shuffled dialogue and Ninetendo Wiimote-controled video projection at the University of Illinois Chicago&rsquo;s Art and Architecture building on March 18 and March 19 at 8 PM.<br><br>

<em>Dog Days</em> is set on the edges of human intersection: where communication breaks down. Performers interact by way of a limited set of phrases, stuttered dialogue and indecipherable utterances. Dialogue randomized by iPod shuffles is repeated by performers as they synch their movements to the interruptions. A Wiimote from the Wii gaming system captures data from the actor&rsquo;s movements and relays it to a projected video control system. The performance questions whether communication beyond transfer of existing information is possible. At the same time, the need to speak is the driving force behind the piece. It also investigates systems of control and the relation of live, human-based theater to mass media.<br><br>

The performance is a collaboration between UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization graduate program and the Department of Performing Arts. Treebridge has been working with Clinical Assistant Professor Sharon Gopfert&rsquo;s &ldquo;Movement for Stage III&rdquo; students to develop Dog Days. These theater students will be featured in the performance.<br><br>
