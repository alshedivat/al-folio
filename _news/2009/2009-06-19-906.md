The Burnham pavilions in Chicago&rsquo;s Millenium Park, designed by Ben van Berkel (UNStudio, Amsterdam) and Zaha Hadid (London) represent the centerpieces of the Burnham Plan Centennial, installed from June 19 until October 31 2009 on the South Chase Promenade (next to the bridge leading into the Modern Wing of the Art Institute).<br><br>

UIC&rsquo;s School of Art &amp; Design and Electronic Visualization program faculty member, Daniel Sauter created the interactive lighting program that illuminates the UNStudio pavilion. &ldquo;At night, the pavilion becomes a responsive architecture with LED lights that change color and pattern. These lights will be in constant flux as the number of visitors to the pavilion changes. Programmatically, the pavilion invites people to gather, walk around and through the space - to explore and observe.&rdquo;<br><br>
