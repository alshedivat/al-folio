EVL congratulates research collaborators at Louisiana State University (LSU) on winning first prize of the Second IEEE International Scalable Computing Challenge (SCALE 2009) at CCGrid 2009!<br><br>

Cactus and a new distributed visualization system formed part of the winning entry from LSU. Researchers at the Center for Computation &amp; Technology (CCT), comprised a scalable, end-to-end, interactive systems for the simulation and visualization of black holes.<br><br>

The winning application consisted of interactive visualization of the data produced using a new parallel renderer with GPU acceleration to render images, and EVL&rsquo;s SAGE middleware to stream to the display. VNC was used instead of SAGE in Shanghai due to local network limitations.<br><br>
