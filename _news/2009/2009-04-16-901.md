EV MFA candidate, Julio Obelleiro&rsquo;s <em>The Viewer</em> is among the winning entries in the University of Illinois at Chicago&rsquo;s <strong>The Image of Research 2009</strong> competition.<br><br>

<strong>The Image of Research</strong> is an annual interdisciplinary exhibit competition to showcase the breadth and diversity of research at UIC. Each year, students enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program at UIC are invited to submit an image with aesthetic appeal created by the student along with a brief pr&eacute;cis of how the image relates to the student&rsquo;s overall research. A multi-disciplinary jury reviews the submissions and awards prizes to 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners and three honorable mentions.<br><br>

<em>The Viewer</em> is among the honorable mention winners. The winning image is a close up of an interactive installation called <em>The Viewer</em>, which consists of a virtual viewer situated in front of the real viewer, and deals with the visualization and comprehension strategies of the work of art. It presents an interactive device that establishes a relation of visual communication with the audience, showing how the viewer acts in relation to the art piece.
