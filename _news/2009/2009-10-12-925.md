<strong><em>Popular Science&rsquo;s: Future of Immortality</em></strong> program that airs October 12th through 14th on Discovery&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Science Channel&rdquo; features EVL&rsquo;s LifeLike project and research in the development of realistic avatars.<br><br>

&ldquo;This is the Electronic Visualization Lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Here cyber scientists - Jason Leigh and Ron DeMara have an undying interest in perpetuating personalities with sophisticated software.<br><br>

This is Alex the avatar. Alex is the digital double of Alex Schwarzkopf a former director of the National Science Foundation. When the NSF began funding project LifeLike, Alex found opportunity to have top scientific minds make him immortal without even becoming a Bond villain.<br><br>

Right now cyber Alex only comes alive when he is turned on; but down the road, he&rsquo;ll be like the old Max Headroom living on-line 24/7, standing in for the real Alex and even appearing several places at once.<br><br>

Avatar Alex combines CG realism with just enough artificial smarts to pick-up verbal and non-verbal cues. In other words, he just doesn&rsquo;t speak - he converses&hellip;&rdquo;
