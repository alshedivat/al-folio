The October 22, 2009 edition of the WASHINGTON POST has an article by Carol Kinsey Goman on <a href="http://views.washingtonpost.com/leadership/leadership_playlist/2009/10/the-high-tech-future-of-body-language.html">&ldquo;The High-Tech Future of Body Language&rdquo;</a>, which talks about the importance of non-verbal queues for those &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; meetings mediated by a screen in the middle. Think video teleconferencing! To impress how non-verbal cues are significant - if not moreso - in our digital future, the author describes five technology and research projects. One of the advancements profiled is &ldquo;Project LifeLike,&rdquo; a collaboration between the Intelligent Systems Laboratory (ISL) at the University of Central Florida (UCF) and the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The article references the May 18th article <a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_articles/lifelike_evl_lab_sets_out_simulate_your_evil_twin">&ldquo;LifeLike - EVL Lab Sets Out To Simulate Your (Evil) Twin&rdquo;</a>, on the website Scientific Blogging - Science 2.0.<br><br>

<a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/lifelike">Project Lifelike</a> receives major funding from the National Science Foundation, award # 0703916 to UIC and UCF.
