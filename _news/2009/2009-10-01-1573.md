Everything from image capture, modification, creation, and output, either on displays or on printers has been rapidly migrating from traditional photographic and print techniques to computer-based techniques. It is inevitable, except in perhaps artistic circumstances, that within 10 years all imaging will have switched over to using computing rather than traditional film and print-based media. While the traditional role of displays has been for the viewing of television programming, over the past 10 years displays have increasingly become portals into virtual environments. It is therefore important to understand the current state of the art in image display technology so that one can begin to anticipate how this technology in the future will evolve, and how best to take advantage of that evolution once it matures. This chapter focuses on the issues of image display and how new advanced displays that are being used mainly in research and higher education today may become commonplace in the next 5-10 years.
