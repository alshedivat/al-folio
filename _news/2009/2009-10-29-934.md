Hubert &ldquo;Grav&rdquo; Weldon showcases his MFA thesis work <em>Meridianus Divinitus</em> at UIC&rsquo;s Center for Virtual Reality &amp; Art (CVRA).<br><br>

<em>Meridianus Divinitus</em> is an exploration and reinterpretation of the body energetic presented as a dynamic electronic visualization experience. According to Eastern philosophies, energy ebbs and flows from the body through energy foci. The primary foci are known as chakras. There are seven chakra points: crown, third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, bowels, and groin. In addition to these major power centers, there are hundreds of minor foci known as meridians that create the spider web of energy spreading the life force throughout the body.<br><br>

Grav uses ancient chakra charts to create a media rich installation, simulating how the body energies flow and connect. <em>Meridianus Divinitus</em> consists of five separate reinterpretations representing the five ancient states of being.<br><br>
