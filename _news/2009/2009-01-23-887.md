EVL MFA candidate, Julio Obelleiro and collaborator Alberto Garcia exhibit their interactive artwork <em>The Magic Torch</em> at The Science Gallery, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland in the <em>Lightwave: Defy the Darkness</em> exhibition.<br><br>

Created during <em>Interactivos? 06</em> at Medialab-Prado, Spain - &ldquo;The Magic Torch&rdquo; was developed by Obelleiro and Garcia with support from Medialab organizers, instructors and participants.<br><br>

<em>Tne Magic Torch</em> is used to paint hundreds of small stars, planets, asteroids and unusual shapes through the torch&rsquo;s beam of light onto a large projection screen. Participants playfully interact with the surface to choreograph fantastical and magical spaces.<br><br>

Widely exhibited since its development in 2006, <em>The Magic Torch</em> is a part of the permanent collection of the CosmoCaixa Science Museum in Madrid.<br><br>
