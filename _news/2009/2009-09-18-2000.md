The Hands-on Automated Nursing Data System (HANDS) is a standardized plan of care method in which the patient&rsquo;s plan is updated at every nurse hand-off allowing the interdisciplinary team to track the story about care and progress toward desired outcomes in a standardized format across time and units.<br><br>

EVL is collaborating with UIC&rsquo;s College of Nursing and College of Engineering on the visual component of the HANDS system. Current goals include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Improving the original HANDS user interface for more potential users such as doctors and therapists</li>
<li>investigating and understanding the needs of prospective users, and adding additional functionality to HANDS to address the needs of those users</li>
<li>Adding visualization to HANDS existing reports in an effort to empower current and future users to do more data exploration and visual analytics</li>
</ul>
