While many visualization tools exist that offer sophisticated functions for charting complex data, they still expect users to possess a high degree of expertise in wielding the tools to create an effective visualization. This poster presents Articulate, an attempt at a semi-automated visual analytic model that is guided by a conversational user interface. The goal is to relieve the user of the physical burden of having to directly craft a visualization through the manipulation of a complex user-interface, by instead being able to verbally articulate what the user wants to see, and then using natural language processing and heuristics to semi-automatically create a suitable visualization.<br><br>
