Electronic Visualization Assistant Professor, Daniel Sauter in collaboration with Fabian Winkler, Assistant Professor at Purdue University&rsquo;s Electronic and Time-Based Art Program, exhibit <em>In the Line of Sight</em> at the Elaine L. Jacob Gallery, Detroit, MI.<br><br>

<em>In the Line of Sight</em> is a light installation that uses 100 computer-controlled tactical flashlights to project low-resolution video footage of moving persons into the exhibition space. Each flashlight projects a light spot - similar to a pixel - on the wall. All flashlights combined create 10 x 10 pixel representations of the source footage. Instead of projections onto flat walls, we imagine the images being projected onto multiple surfaces, i.e. corners, floors, ceilings, using the architectural elements that are specific to the site.<br><br>

<em>In the Line of Sight</em> is an artistic exploration of the aesthetic potential of extreme low-resolution video projections with a projection device that is integral part of the installation itself. It explores electronic images not as simulations of reality but as objects, anchored in and defined by the physical space.<br><br>
