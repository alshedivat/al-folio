Gamer&rsquo;s obsessions vary. It could be jacking an Escalade in Liberty City; creating a new avatar in a computer virtual world, or even pulling out an old school Nintendo to dominate in &ldquo;Paperboy.&rdquo;<br><br>

But learning how to create the newest obsession is a secondary part of the curriculum for students in game development and computer science. Instead, they are learning a different set of skills, one that mom&rsquo;s worldwide pull their hair out trying to teach their own children: how to work well with others.<br><br>

&ldquo;Talent is important, but it falls below several other qualities on the list: team player, accountability, showing up, and collaboration,&rdquo; said Howard Tullman, president and chief executive officer of Chicago-based Flashpoint: The Academy of Media Arts and Sciences.<br><br>

Leading a tour group of about 100 parents and potential students, Tullman repeatedly emphasized that attending Flashpoint is not a lackadaisical undertaking. The two years at the academy more closely resemble two years of work experience than a typical undergraduate education. Currently, 60 of the 275 students going into their second year at Flashpoint are game development students.<br><br>

&ldquo;We are interested in turning out people who are complete digital professionals,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They know how to work with a budget, they can communicate, read and write. The focus is having a job to go to at the end, developing a real world portfolio.&rdquo;<br><br>

A similar theme runs through the game development course at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The course is part of the four-year computer science program at the university and is co-taught through teleconferencing with instructors at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.<br><br>

Program director Jason Leigh assigns the 30 or so students into teams of four, with two members in each location to force the students into honing their collaboration skills.<br><br>

&ldquo;They learn that one of the most difficult challenges is maintaining awareness of what the other half of the team is doing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The teams that establish strong protocols for communication are usually ones that succeed. Interestingly, the teams that did the most poorly this semester were the ones that were entirely co-located.&rdquo;
