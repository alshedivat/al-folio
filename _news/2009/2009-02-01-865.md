EVL MFA graduate student, Lindsay Grace presents his research <em>gReader: A Universally Designed, Device-Independent Email Client</em> at the Second International Conferences on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions (ACHI 09), Cancun, Mexico.<br><br>

This project proposes a plan for offering access to e-mail that is largely platform independent. <em>gReader</em> is the design of a Text-To-Speech (TTS) application that reads e-mail to users, records the messages in two popular media types for transfer to portable entertainment devices (PET) and portable communications devices (PCD). A user task analysis was conducted on eight users ranging from ages 19 to 34; the prototype succeeded in delivering email content in an easily comprehended manner.<br><br>

Results of this research will be described and discussed as part of the symposium&rsquo;s Interaction &amp; Interface Design &amp; Evaluation Track to be held, Thursday, February 5th, 1:45pm - 3:30pm.
