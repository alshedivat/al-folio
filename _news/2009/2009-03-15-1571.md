The current inability to realistically simulate and test dynamic user interfaces of mobile device prototypes is one of the prime limiting factors to successful product launches. Current processes provide very little insight into inter-relationships among physical form of the product, the human-machine interface and the applications that run on those devices. In this paper, we present a technique that provides a common platform where product designers, user interface developers and software programmers can interactively visualize and test their new concepts by exploring and touching a 3D virtual reality prototype using Augmented Reality and Haptics. This simulation tool can enhance or even replace traditional prototyping and facilitate testing of the prototype at various points of the design cycle.<br><br>
