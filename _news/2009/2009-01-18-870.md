EVL alumni, Stephen Cady (MFA 2008), presently with the University of Advancing Technology, Arizona presents his EVL thesis work entitled, <strong><em>Chiasmus</em></strong> at the Human Vision and Electronic Imaging XIV Conference.<br><br>

As part of the symposium&rsquo;s program track on Imaging, Visualization, and Perception, Stephen will contribute to the session on Art and Perception, Thursday, 22 January, 1:30 PM - 4:40 PM.  Following the presentation of this work, Stephen will join the panel discussion on this topic.<br><br>

<em>Chiasmus</em>is a responsive and dynamically reflective, two-sided volumetric projection surface that embodies phenomenological issues such as the formation and reception of images, observer and machine perception and the dynamics of the screen as a space of image reception. It consists of a square grid of 64 individually motorized cube elements engineered to move linearly. Each cube is controlled by custom software that analyzes video imagery for luminance values and sends these values to the motor control mechanisms to coordinate the individual movements. The resolution of the sculptural screen from the individual movements allows its volume to dynamically alter, providing novel and unique perspectives of its mobile form to an observer.
