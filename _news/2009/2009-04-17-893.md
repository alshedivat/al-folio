<em>Critical Gameplay</em> is a collection of strategically designed video games. Each game asks the question, what do common game mechanics teach us?  The four games in the collection are designed to help reevaluate our perspective on gameplay experiences. Like Critical Cartography changes the way we perceive the world, <em>Critical Gameplay</em> seeks to offer alternate perspectives on the way we play.<br><br>

<strong>The Exhibition</strong><br>
Four video games will be displayed for visitors to play on multiple stations. Each game takes a specific gameplay standard and actively works against it. The hope is the initiation of an intellectual dialogue about the opportunities in unexplored gameplay mechanics.<br><br>

The exhibition will also include other video games and interactive works created by Lindsay Grace.<br><br>

The exhibition is open to the public and will be held on April 17th.<br><br>

<strong>Opening Reception:</strong> 6:30 pm<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> 1100 West Cermac (enter at 2268 S. Carpenter)<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 6:30pm - 10:00pm<br>
<strong>Cost:</strong> Free (Open to the public)<br><br>

<em>Refreshments will be served.</em>
