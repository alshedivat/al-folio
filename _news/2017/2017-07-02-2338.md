JULY 3, 2017 - Maxine Brown, director of the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), participated in the Brazilian Symposium on Collaborative Systems (SBSC – Simposio Brasileiro de Sistemas Colaborativos), which was part of the Brazilian Computer Society general conference and held on the campus of Mackenzie Presbyterian University in Sao Paulo, Brazil.<br><br>
Brown was invited by long-time collaborator Jane de Almeida, co-chair of SBSC, director of Mackenzie&rsquo;s LabCine (Laboratorio de Artes Cinematicas e Visualizacao) and a long-time SAGE2 user. De Almeida felt that the audience, primarily academic and industrial researchers and graduate students, would find EVL&rsquo;s research in computer-supported collaborative work, particularly SAGE2, of interest. Brown gave the keynote &ldquo;Insight Through Images: Visualization and Collaboration Technologies for Exploring Big Data.&rdquo; She also participated in a panel discussion &ldquo;The next 10 years of collaborative systems,&rdquo; toured the LabCine, and gave a videotaped interview on her impressions of the conference and thoughts about the future.<br><br>
