## Englewood Social Service Finder and Englewood Analytics



![image](/images/edhub.png-srcw.jpg){:style="max-width: 100%"}

The Englewood Data Hub (EDH) is a project that brings together both crowdsourced and public data surrounding the Englewood area into a single place.<br><br>
The <a href="https://englewooddatahub.org/">EDH Resource Directory</a> makes use of the crowdsourced service and school data to display an interactive map with their locations. Its user interface (UI) allows for an exploratory experience that offers filtering of services by names and type and displays detailed information about the services available in Englewood.<br><br>
The <a href="https://englewooddatahub.org/analytics">EDH Analytics Tool</a> combines the crowdsourced service and school data with public data sets to display visualizations; specifically, the public datasets used are 2010 Census data along with Vacant Lot and Crime data from the Chicago Data Portal.<br><br>
The Englewood Data Hub has been developed by a group of researchers at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory, University of Illinois at Chicago under the direction of Prof. G. Elisabeta Marai.<br><br>
Team members include EVL research experience undergraduate students (REUs): Andrew Burks, Joshua Castor, and Isabel Lindmae.<br><br>
This project is funded by the The Joseph and Bessie Feinberg Foundation and the University of Illinois at Chicago.
