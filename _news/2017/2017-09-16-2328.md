Today&rsquo;s UIC Open House welcomed prospective students, their parents, and the general public to tour the campus and learn more about the many academic programs offered. As part of the day&rdsquo;s events, the Computer Science department organized numerous faculty talks, a student panel, and campus tours, including CAVE2 demos from the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL). &ldquo;Team EVL&rdquo; presented nine 20-minute demos, with 20-30 attendees each. Audiences were enthusiastic and asked lots of questions. Though tiring, a good time was had by all.<br><br>
