Recent data demonstrate that human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancers (OPC) have discrete biology and clinical behavior as compared to HPV-negative OPC. We hypothesize that some phenotypic image features can be correlated to tumor biology in a non-invasive fashion. Some imaging features, specifically shape and intensity features can make a distinction between HPV-associated and HPV-negative OPC. Quantitative information from pretreatment imaging of intact tumor can give a better idea on tumor biology. Further studies are needed to validate the correlation between these radiomic biomarkers and other intrinsic tumor characteristics.<br><br>
