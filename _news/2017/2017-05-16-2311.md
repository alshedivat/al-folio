Exploring big cities like Chicago can be a daunting experience when the tourist has to gather information from multiple sources regarding places, directions, transportation, safety, and weather.  We propose a large display solution (kiosks) which aims to encourage people to explore the city by showing cultural attractions, special events and other points of interest (POI) on a map along with multi-modal transportation options to take them to their destination. POI&rsquo;s and events are updated frequently based on the time and safety information. Kiosks are intended to be located throughout the city especially locations with the highest density of points of interest.
