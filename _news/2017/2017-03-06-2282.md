Tom&rsquo;s commitment to advance both technology and the common good is evident to all who are fortunate to work with him. Maxine Brown has worked with Tom DeFanti since 1977, and is now Director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago, which Tom co-founded with art professor Dan Sandin in 1973.
