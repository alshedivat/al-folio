<strong>SAGE2 @ SC17: Demonstrations, Birds of a Feather, and SCinet Participation</strong><br><br>
NOVEMBER 12-16, 2017 - Members of the SAGE2&trade; Team who attended the IEEE/ACM SC17 conference - from University of Hawai ªi at Manoa&rsquo;s Laboratory for Advanced Visualization &amp; Applications (LAVA), University of Illinois at Chicago&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), and University of Hawaiz&rsquo;i at Hilo - were involved in many tech transfer activities, notably research demonstrations, a Birds of a Feather (BOF) meeting, and developing visual analytics of network performance for the SCinet DevOps team. The SC17 conference was held at the Colorado Convention Center in Denver.<br><br>
<strong>SAGE2 BOF</strong><br><br>
The &ldquo;SAGE2 9th Annual International SC BOF: Scalable Amplified Group Environment for Global Collaboration&rdquo; meeting was held on Thursday, November 16. The BOF provided a Forum for SAGE2 developers to meet with the the SAGE/SAGE2 global user community and potential users; specifically:<br>
<ul><ul><ul>
<li>To introduce key SAGE2 team members
<li>To highlight new SAGE2 sites and applications
<li>To provide an overview of the 2017 SAGE2 user survey and recommended roadmap
<li>To introduce SAGE2 v3 (named &ldquo;Waipi&rsquo;o&rdquo;)

<strong>SAGE2 Demonstrations</strong><br><br>
SAGE2 demonstrations took place in the Center for Data Intensive Science/Open Commons Consortium research booth on the exhibition floor, November 13-16, 2017.  Booth attendees saw firsthand SAGE2 v3&rsquo;s many new and advanced features, and talked with the key developers:<br>
<ul><ul><ul>
<li>SAGE2Cloud: create and manage SAGE2 server instances in Docker containers</li>
<li>JupyterLab plugin: link your science workflows with SAGE2 using the next version of Jupyter</li>
<li>Performance monitoring: monitor performance of your server and display clients</li>
<li>A user management system</li>
<li>Unity3D apps (WebGL export)</li>
<li>Remote collaboration features: remote view, remote pointers</li>
<li>Voice commands</li>
<li>Better webviews and user interface</li>
</ul></ul></ul><br>
<strong>SAGE2 SCinet Participation</strong><br><br>
SCinet is the SC conference&rsquo;s highly sophisticated, high-performance network infrastructure that is designed and implemented by a large group of academic, government and industry volunteers. SCinet&rsquo;s DevOps Team runs the internal software infrastructure for SCinet - including software to monitor and measure network flows to ensure services and provide alerts when there are issues. Starting last year, SCinet organizers used SAGE2 on a tiled display wall outside their Network Operations Center in order to provide attendees with large-scale images about the network. This year, SCinet continued to use SAGE2, but also wanted help producing visualizations of network flows to gain more insight into usage. Andrew Burks, a member of the SAGE2 Team from EVL, produced several visual analytic diagrams over the course of the week, which were displayed both on SCinet&rsquo;s wall as well as in the SAGE2 research booth.<br><br>
