EVL alumna (MFA 2000) and associate professor of Media Study at the University of Buffalo, Josephine Anstey continues her creative endeavors with the launch of her animated short, &ldquo;Pik and Etty in Progressive Taxation&rdquo; at the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/yeswecannibal">Yes We Cannibal Salon</a> on November 21, 2021 at 5pm EST/4pm CST.<br><br>
Pik and Etty are economic commentators and re-enactors.  With a rich cast of other clay figures they feature in short animations inspired by radical economist Thomas Piketty.  Between 1900-1980 the &ldquo;ninety percent&rdquo; got richer and the &ldquo;ten percent&rdquo; got poorer.  This <a href="https://yeswecannibal.org/encounters/meat-meet-35-josephine-anstey/">second Pik and Etty video</a> discusses the role of taxation in spreading the wealth.<br><br>
