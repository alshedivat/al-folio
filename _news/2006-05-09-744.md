EVL&rsquo;s Ph.D. student Xun Luo was chosen again by Google, Inc. to participate in the company&rsquo;s Summer of Code 2006 program. Xun&rsquo;s proposal &ldquo;Multivariate Analysis for PIM Data&rdquo; was among 6,000 applications submitted to the 2006 competition; it features the design and implementation of intelligent computation module for Personal Information Managers (PIMs).<br><br>

Xun was granted a $4,500 stipend by Google to complete the project with technical mentoring by the Open Source Application Foundation, Philippe Bossut.  The completed software module is incorporated into Chandler - a leading open source PIM software, which builds upon the experimentally usable calendar for individuals and small workgroups (see <a href="http://chandler.osafoundation.org">chandler.osafoundation.org</a>).<br><br>

Google Summer of Code is a program that offers student developers stipends to create new open source programs or to help currently established projects. Since the program&rsquo;s inception in 2005 mentor organization participation has nearly tripled to 102. In addition to the organizations that participated last year, organizations such as GNU, Gentoo, Adium and PHP have joined the program. The event draws its name from the 1967 Summer of Love.<br><br>

Xun Luo&rsquo;s proposal is available online at: <a href="http://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/2006/">developers.google.com/open-source/soc/2006/</a>
