EVL MFA candidates, Helen-Nicole Kostis and Tina Shah will be hosting the next open-node gathering on Thursday, July 6 in EVL&rsquo;s BATCAVE. Open-node consists of a group of artists, teachers, students, and curators in Chicago. Each monthly meeting features a presentation by 1 or more artists.<br><br>

The evening will begin with a tour of interactive works by Helen-Nicole Kostis and Tina Shah, followed by short presentations from each of them on their latest research and art.<br><br>

Helen-Nicole Kostis will be presenting &ldquo;skin&rdquo;, an interactive, stereoscopic video installation that explores the intersection of the body as landscape / mindscape as well as the traces of touch on the virtual bodies left by participants.<br><br>

Tina Shah will be presenting &ldquo;Cue&rdquo;, a systems-based artwork representing the visual processing experienced during moments of recollection. By designing an algorithm to track relationships between the artist&rsquo;s database of video memories and images captured in real time in the exhibition space, a unique perspective and relationship is formed between public and private memories.<br><br>
