EVL faculty, staff, and students organized the Showcase event as an experiment to establish an environment for computational scientists to interactively present their research at a major professional conference in a one-to-many format on high end workstations attached to large projection screens. The CAVE&reg; was introduced at this conference as the display device for Showcase.
