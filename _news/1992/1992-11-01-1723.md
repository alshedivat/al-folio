The CAVE&rsquo;s immersive virtual environment enables participants to walk around mathematical shapes, step through complex surfaces, or move a surface through itself. Virtual reality encourages users to see shapes from a new perspective - from the inside, looking out - and to explore and manipulate complex surfaces in order to better understand them.<br><br>
 
Topology is the study of the characteristics of mathematical surfaces, such as their number of sides, edges, or holes. This program uses free-form deformations to study the topology of mathematical surfaces. Deforming a surface changes its shape, but not its characteristics; an edge remains an edge, and a hole remains a hole, no matter how distorted the edge or hole appears. The claim of topologists that a donut (torus) and a coffee cup are topologically equivalent is one of the deformations demonstrated in this program.<br><br>

This application was a part of Experiential Science in The Virtual Reality Theater venue at Supercomputing &rsquo;93, and VROOM - the Virtual Reality Room event showcased at SIGGRAPH 94.
