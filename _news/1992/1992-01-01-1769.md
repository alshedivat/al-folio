<strong>CAVE&trade;</strong><br>
The CAVE&trade; is a multi-person, room-sized, high-resolution 3D video and audio environment invented at EVL in 1991. Graphics are projected in stereo onto three walls and the floor, and viewed with active stereo glasses equipped with a location sensor. As the user moves within the display boundaries, the correct perspective is displayed in real-time to achieve a fully immersive experience.<br><br>

<strong>Bright Advanced Technology (BAT) CAVE&trade;</strong><br>
In June 2001, EVL built the next-generation Bright Advanced Technology CAVE&trade;, or BAT CAVE, using Christie Digital Systems&rsquo; Mirage 5000 projectors - the first DLP-based Active Stereoscopic projector - and near-black screens for higher contrast.<br><br>

The BAT CAVE&rsquo;s brightness, clarity and enhanced depth perspective produce more captivating real-time, real-life projection simulations than previous CAVE&trade; technology.
