The ideas of genetic evolution combine with computer science and art to create aesthetically pleasing shapes and sounds. A gene is a symbolic mathematical expression that determines the unique geometric shape and sound of an object in this virtual world.<br><br>

CAVE participants rotate, mutate or marry objects to other objects of the same generation, or request the system to recalculate the objects in high-resolution mode (which affects the computer&rsquo;s response time).<br><br>

The CAVE enables participants to explore these genetic lifeforms, both visually and aurally, in a true 3D environment. This research employs a new algorithm for genetic evolution, recognizes shape and sound as integral components of its lifeforms, algorithmically generates shapes and sounds based on a user&rsquo;s selection criteria, and displays the lifeforms in a surround-screen, surround-sound environment.<br><br>

This application was a part of Experiential Science in The Virtual Reality Theater venue at Supercomputing &rsquo;93.
