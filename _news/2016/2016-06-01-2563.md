PURPOSE<br>
To develop methods for rapid and simultaneous design, testing, and management of multiple clinical decision support (CDS) features to aid nurse decision-making.<br><br>
METHODS<br>
We used quota sampling, think-aloud and cognitive interviews, and deductive and inductive coding of synchronized audio-video data and archival libraries.<br><br>
FINDINGS<br>
Our methods and organizational tools allowed us to rapidly improve the usability, understandability, and usefulness of CDS in a generalizable sample of practicing nurses.<br><br>
CONCLUSIONS<br>
The method outlined allows the rapid integration of nursing terminology-based electronic health record data into routine workflow and holds strong potential for improving patient outcomes.<br><br>
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE<br>
The methods and organizational tools for the development of multiple CDS system features can be used to translate knowledge into practice.
