In January 2016, Siying Li, a graduate student at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University covering technology innovations for arts, contacted the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) to do a story. More specifically, he contacted UIC computer science PhD student and EVL research assistant Arthur Nishimoto to learn more about what he was doing.<br><br>
Li was pleasantly surprised to learn that Nishimoto has, in his spare time, been adding lots of new features to his StarTrek Enterprise starship and is also developing a Star Wars game in the CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment. Nishimoto&rsquo;s actual research at EVL, under advisor Andy Johnson, CS associate professor and EVL director of research, focuses on user interaction techniques and application development.<br><br>

The original [Death Star] model, featured in the first Star Wars film, was built there at the University&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory. The iconic film from 1977 made its latest comeback in late 2015 with the release of &ldquo;Star Wars: The Force Awakens.&rdquo; And so did a re-imagined Death Star, again created at UIC.<br><br>
Arthur Nishimoto, a second-year computer science doctoral student and research associate at EVL, is a Star Wars fan. He worked in his spare time to bring back the Death Star with virtual reality technology.<br><br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s cool about my Death Star simulation is that it&rsquo;s built at the actual size of a moon virtually,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just making a model of the Death Star. It&rsquo;s making a Death Star at full scale.&rdquo; And you can walk inside this Death Star.<br><br>
&ldquo;I feel fortunate to have CAVE2 as an ultimate canvas to work on and view my artworks,&rdquo; said Nishimoto, as he opened a door inside the Death Star with a computer-generated laser pointer.<br><br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to think beyond the model - for example, I can make this ship fly around the Death Star like in any video game, but what if this is actually a real ship that we can apply real physics to?&rdquo; Nishimoto said. &ldquo;I always try to bring real science back into the fictional world.&rdquo;<br><br>
CAVE2 helps this happen, even for researchers besides computer scientists and video game designers.<br><br>
