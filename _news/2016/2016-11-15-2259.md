<strong>SAGE2&trade;: Scalable Amplified Group Environment for Global Collaboration Birds of a Feather (BOF)</strong><br><br>
Tuesday, November 15, 2016, 12:15PM–01:15PM<br>
Salt Palace Convention Center, Room: 250-E, Salt Lake City, Utah<br><br>
SAGE2 is an innovative, user-centered, web-based platform that enables local and/or distributed teams to display, manage, share and investigate large-scale datasets on tiled display walls in order to glean insights and discoveries. SAGE2 enables users to easily display and juxtapose digital media (2D/3D charts, graphs, images, movies or documents) from a variety of sources. SAGE2, announced at SC14, is the next-generation SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment), which was the defacto operating system for managing Big Data content on tiled display walls for almost a decade. SAGE2 provides the scientific community with persistent visualization and collaboration services for global cyberinfrastructure.<br><br>
This BOF provided a Forum for SAGE2 developers to meet with the the SAGE/SAGE2 global user community and potential users; specifically:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>to introduce key SAGE2 team members</li>
<li>to highlight SAGE2 research and education applications</li>
<li>to review SAGE2 capabilities and applications</li>
<li>to provide an overview of the SAGE2 roadmap</li>
<li>to solicit feedback</li></ul><br>
In addition, SAGE2 demonstrations took place in the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) research booth on the exhibition floor, November 14-17, 2016.<br><br>
