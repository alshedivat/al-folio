This paper presents a guideline for visualization designers who want to choose appropriate techniques for enhancing tasks involving   multidimensional projection. Specifically, we adopt a user-centric approach in which we take user perception into consideration. Here, we focus on projection techniques that output 2D or 3D scatterplots that can then be used for a range of common data analysis tasks, which we categorize as pattern identification tasks, relation-seeking tasks, membership disambiguation tasks, or behavior comparison tasks. Our user-centric task categorization can be used to effectively guide the organization of multidimensional data projection layouts. Moreover, we present real-world examples that demonstrate effective choices made by visualization designers faced with complex datasets requiring dimensionality reduction.<br><br>
<strong>Keywords:</strong> Multidimensional data analysis, task taxonomy, multidimensional data projection, user-centric evaluation.
