Old Crow Smokehouse<br>
149 W Kinzie Street, Chicago, IL<br><br>
Research Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL),  Luc Renambot presents his research in interactive techniques and collaboration using advanced visualization displays and high-speed networking at the <a href="http://live.nodejs.org/events/chicago.html">&ldquo;Node.js Live - Chicago&rdquo;</a><br><br>
Renambot directs a team of researchers at EVL developing SAGE2&trade;.  SAGE2 is a Node.js and browser-based environment that creates a seamless ultra-high resolution desktop across a display wall (one to many displays). Users can wirelessly connect to the wall to interact with the system, transfer documents, manipulate applications and share their screen. Data visualization applications can be created quickly using 3rd party library such as D3.js, Snap, Vega, WebGL, and be integrated into the SAGE2 API.
