We describe the lessons learned from three recent Immersive Analytics projects which take place at the Electronic Visualization Lab. These successful collaborative projects use the CAVE2 immersive hybrid environment. All three projects visualize multifaceted scientific data and benefit from interdisciplinary collaborations with experts across application domains. We further outline the challenges and opportunities ahead for the field of Immersive Analytics.<br><br>
