To announce OpenGrid, a new and innovative website enabling the public to navigate City data using an intuitive and visual interface, the City of Chicago&rsquo;s Department of Innovation &amp; Technology wanted a high-tech stage. Several stages, in fact, so that invited media and partners could listen to presentations in one environment and then move to another for demos and hands-on experiences. They came to the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago to host the event.<br><br>
Brenna Berman, the City&rsquo;s Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Commissioner of the Department of Innovation & Technology, and Tom Schenk, Jr., Chief Data Officer (CDO), presented OpenGrid in EVL&rsquo;s Cyber-Commons room, followed by multiple demos in the CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment. They explained OpenGrid&rsquo;s technical capabilities, but also its human capabilities - as it makes City data more readily accessible to Chicago communities, providing its citizens with the information they need to solve problems relevant to their communities.<br><br>
Data portals organize data by individual datasets, making it difficult to combine data and see what is happening in one&rsquo;s neighborhood. OpenGrid is a public website that makes the Chicago Data Portal more easily available to all residents. Users can select areas on a map of the City, on which to graphically view locations of inspections, street closures, potholes, crimes, and other activities.<br><br>
Chicago&rsquo;s investment in open data, along with strategic partnerships with civic tech volunteers and pro bono corporations, has also helped improve the city&rsquo;s services. EVL is proud to have helped this initiative!<br><br>
