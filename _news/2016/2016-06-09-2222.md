Thursday, June 9, 2016<br>
7:00 PM to 10:00 PM<br><br>
Woman Made Gallery<br>
685 N Milwaukee Ave, Chicago, IL<br><br>
UIC Computer Science Ph.D. candidate and EVL graduate research assistant, Jillian Aurisano describes her work with bacterial genomics researchers to develop new approaches to visualizing neighborhoods around genes of interest in hundreds of complete bacterial genome sequences. The application she developed, <i>BactoGeNIE</i> aims to be both visually scalable for large collections of genome sequences and to take advantage of large, high-resolution display environments, like tiled-display walls.<br><br>
The challenges of bringing a visual perspective to big data problems in science and the new opportunities presented by advanced graphics environments for data visualization in science will be discussed.<br><br>
This presentation is part of a seminar series organized by <a href="https://womanmade.org/">Woman Made Gallery</a>, held in conjunction with Woman Made Gallery's CODE/SWITCH + CODE/MIX & Quest exhibitions.<br><br>
