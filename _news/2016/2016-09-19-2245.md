Capitalizing on Star Trek&rsquo;s 50th anniversary, which debuted on September 8, 1966, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has developed a social media #holodeck campaign to promote its support of cutting-edge research in virtual reality and immersive environments. NSF recognizes that the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) has a long history of leadership in this area, so not only included the lab in its campaign, but kicked off its campaign by highlighting EVL&rsquo;s work.<br><br>
Specifically, NSF is focusing on Star Trek&rsquo;s Holodeck - a virtual reality environment that can fabricate lifelike experiences and enable training, research and development, mental and physical health, entertainment and exploration. Coincidentally, the term &ldquo;holodeck&rdquo; has often been applied to EVL&rsquo;s CAVE&trade; Automatic Virtual Environment, introduced in 1992, and its CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment, introduced in 2012. Both these unique displays were designed and built with major funding from NSF.<br><br>
Inspired by the CAVE2 system, UIC Computer Science graduate student and EVL research assistant Arthur Nishimoto spent much of his spare time over the past several years developing a full-scale virtual model of Star Trek&rsquo;s starship Enterprise. The CAVE2 is a holodeck-like room that transports people who enter to the Enterprise, where they can walk through various rooms or fly through the cosmos. NSF selected a photo of Nishimoto in the CAVE2 environment, controlling the Enterprise, to put on its introductory blog.<br><br>
The Holodeck, as envisioned by Star Trek&rsquo;s creator Gene Roddenberry, is a fully-immersive artificial environment you can enter and experience with all your senses. The Holodeck is several decades away, and will take a great deal of basic research in computer visualization, sensors, data analysis, perceptual psychology and a range of other disciplines, as well as technological advances in virtual reality, augmented reality, holography, displays, projection and brain-machine interfaces. EVL, along with its many collaborators, has been involved in all these areas.<br><br>
NSF has been supporting research in virtual reality and immersive environments since the 1970s - predating &ldquo;Star Trek: Next Generation.&rdquo; Its goal for the #holodeck campaign is to raise awareness among public, media and legislative audiences of the science and engineering challenges involved in creating the Holodeck - or immersive experiences generally - and to promote the work of its many federally-supported researchers who are developing radically new kinds of multi-sensory experiences using computing and engineered devices.<br><br>

In an homage to Star Trek, Arthur Nishimoto spent his spare time over several years creating a 3D virtual-reality replica of the starship Enterprise for EVL&rsquo;s CAVE2&trade;. Enterprise exterior model developed by Dennis Baily and Eric Clark.
