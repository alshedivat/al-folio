Patients come to Centers for Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation from all over the globe, &ldquo;often with catastrophic or unusual conditions and always with great hope for an improved life ahead&rdquo;. In the quest to assist these patients, Virtual Rehabilitation is becoming popular in clinical research thanks to the development and availability of new immersive technologies. For example, the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients frequently uses virtual reality, and sometimes employs a first-person Serious Games approach to make therapy more enjoyable for patients. In such approaches, the patient experiences the virtual environment in a first-person view.<br><br>
Unlike the existing body of work, we present and evaluate an immersive virtual rehabilitation application which uses a third person perspective: the patient controls with her body a 3D avatar. The application was commissioned by biomechanics researchers at a major center for rehabilitation research, and could be used to compare the learning-curve and time needed for rehabilitation across different therapies and environments. One of the main challenges in this work is the design of simple, non-distracting avatars and virtual world, which allows the patient to focus on performing correctly the rehabilitation exercises. An additional challenge comes from the trade-offs typically associated with virtual reality, for example, loss of depth perception.<br><br>
Our solution, <i>RehabJim</i>, is a third-person serious game for the rehabilitation of upper limbs in post-stroke patients, with particular emphasis on reaching movements. Our solution uses a state-of-the-art virtual reality environment, Unity 3D, and a Kinect controller in the CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment.
