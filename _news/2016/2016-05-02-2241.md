Room 1000, Science & Engineering Office Building, UIC<br><br>
UIC Computer Science and EVL exchange student from the Politecnico di Milano in Italy, Andrea Purgato presents his thesis research that explores the optimization of the similarity computation among nodes for spatio-temporal networks.<br><br>
This research is divided into two parts. The first aspect is to develop a GPU-based computation system to speed up the networks definition. The second uses the GPU-based method developed initially to develop an interactive visualization tool focused specifically on brain network visualizations.
