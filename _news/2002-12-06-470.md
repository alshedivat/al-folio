EVLers Jason Leigh, Andrew Johnson and Atul Nayak are presenting <em>Wiggleview</em>  at the American Geophysical Union 2002 Fall Meeting. Using the AGAVE / GeoWall, the <em>Wiggleview</em> version exhibited in the IRIS booth at AGU will display real-time seismic data retrieved from the CORBA server in Seattle, Washington. The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (<a href="http://www.iris.edu">IRIS</a>) is a university research consortium dedicated to exploring the Earth&rsquo;s interior through the collection and distribution of seismographic data. Support for IRIS comes from the National Science Foundation, other federal agencies, universities, and private foundations.<br><br>

<em>Wiggleview</em> is a tool developed by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) for visualizing seismic data. Data for seismic events is obtained from repositories maintained by IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) at the Data Management Center (DMC) in Seattle, Washington.<br><br>

The <em>Wiggleview</em> visualizations consist of a topographical map and 2D North / South (green lines), East / West (white lines) and vertical (pink lines) seismic traces recorded at each station in a worldwide network of seismometers. In addition, yellow 3D particle traces integrate the three components, and depict the actual tremors occurring at the instance of an event.<br><br>

The tool&rsquo;s strength lies in being able to depict as many as 60 channels of waveforms and 20 traces of particle motion on a single display. This allows one to watch the seismic wave field expand about a source and see how it differs from place to place. It can also assist in understanding surface wave multipathing and anisotropy. The 3D nature of the images enhances depth perception, thus allowing a better understanding of attenuation due to distance and earth structure, source directivity and seismic hazard estimation.<br><br>
