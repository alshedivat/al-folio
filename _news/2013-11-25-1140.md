<strong>Stefan Eileman (Polytechnic Federal School, Lausanne, Switzerland) presents his research interest in the Blue Brain and Human Brain Projects.</strong><br><br> 

The Blue Brain Project and the Human Brain Project build and simulate realistic models of brain tissue. Scaling this to the human brain represents a &ldquo;grand challenge&rdquo; science use case to drive the technological development of supercomputing hardware to the exascale and give guidance for the necessary software components for operating such supercomputers as scientific instruments.<br><br>

High Performance Computing is facing multiple technical challenges, such as a &ldquo;power wall&rdquo;, a &ldquo;memory wall&rdquo; and a &ldquo;parallelism wall&rdquo;. Proven paradigms, best practices and software packages have to be re-thought to overcome those obstacles. In this process, other innovative areas such as Big Data, Gaming and others will help to modernize HPC upon a foundation of novel building blocks for future systems.<br><br>

We will present our and our partner&rsquo;s visualization software and hardware infrastructure, engineering efforts and future plans. We will motivate our current vision for Interactive Supercomputing and High-Performance Visualization to encourage collaboration with the visualization and HPC communities.
