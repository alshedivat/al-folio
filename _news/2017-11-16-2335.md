For those attending SC17 in Denver, Colorado, we will hold the &ldquo;SAGE2 9th Annual International SC BOF: Scalable Amplified Group Environment for Global Collaboration&rdquo; Birds of a Feather (BOF) meeting:<br><br>
* Thursday, November 16<br>
* 12:15PM - 01:15PM<br>
* Room: 503-504, Colorado Convention Center, Denver, CO<br>

SAGE2 (Scalable Amplified Group Environment) is an innovative, open-source, web-based, user-centered platform for small groups or large distributed teams to share and jointly discuss digital media content on tiled displays in order to glean insights and discoveries. SAGE2 treats tiled displays as a seamless ultra-high-resolution desktop, enabling users to juxtapose content from various sources. SAGE2, like its predecessor SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment), is the defacto operating system for managing Big Data on tiled walls, providing the scientific community with persistent visualization and collaboration services for global cyberinfrastructure.<br><br>
This BOF provides a Forum for SAGE2 developers to meet with the the SAGE/SAGE2 global user community and potential users; specifically:<br><br>
* to introduce key SAGE2 team members<br> 
* to highlight SAGE2 research and education applications<br>
* to review SAGE2 capabilities and applications<br>
* to provide an overview of the SAGE2 roadmap<br>
* to solicit feedback<br><br>
To see SAGE2 demonstrations, visit us at the Center for Data Intensive Science/Open Commons Consortium research booth on the exhibition floor from Tuesday-Thursday, Booth # 1653.<br><br>
Together, we can advance scientific research and education by providing production-quality, community-driven, end-user open services for visualization and collaboration that utilize shared national and international cyberinfrastructure.<br><br>
See you at SC17!<br><br>
