CAVE2&trade; Open Houses are being held this semester to accommodate people interested in experiencing UIC&rsquo;s new Virtual Reality Environment. Developed by the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), this new system has more brightness, contrast and resolution than the original CAVE&trade; System that EVL pioneered in 1992. Immerse yourselves in cyberspace - fly over Mars, enter molecular structures, stand inside train tracks to observe distortion as high-speed trains roar past, explore the brain&rsquo;s vasculature, or walk through architectural spaces.<br><br>

Open Houses will be held 3-6pm in the Engineering Research Facility on Wednesday, February 20, April 3 and April 24. Complete the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/c3jutwe">Open House sign-up form</a> to participate. Space is limited, and drop-ins are not guaranteed admittance.<br><br>
