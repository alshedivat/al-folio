EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: Network World, published by IDG (International Data Group) company, is the premier provider of information, intelligence and insight for Network and IT Executives. It&rsquo;s January 21, 2015 tech news briefing features the article &ldquo;10 cool network and computing research projects&rdquo; by Bob Brown, one of which is &ldquo;Articulate,&rdquo; a joint project of UIC computer science faculty members Barbara Di Eugenio (PI), Andy Johnson (co-PI) and Adjunct CS Professor Leland Wilkinson (co-PI), and University of Hawaii at Manoa computer science faculty member Jason Leigh (PI).<br><br>

In the article, under the subheading &ldquo;Picture Perfect Computers,&rdquo; Articulate is described as a &ldquo;conversational and interpretive computer that can create easy-to-digest visualizations from data based on natural language requests and common gestures like pointing.&rdquo;<br><br>

The article goes on to quote Andrew Johnson, director of research at UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL). &ldquo;Today, with big data, you really need to be using visualizations to help you figure out what it is you&rsquo;re looking atâ€¦Visualization should be interactive; a dynamic process. We want scientists to be able get ideas out there quickly.&rdquo;<br><br>

Other institutions mentioned in the article as doing &ldquo;cool projects&rdquo; include Microsoft, Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, Cornell, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Chicago, Rice, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum in Germany, MIT, Georgia Tech and University of Massachusetts Amherst.<br><br>
