Associate Professor, Andrew Johnson presents EVL&rsquo;s Cyber-Commons technology at the 2013 TechTeach@UIC Conference, Wednesday, October 9th at the UIC Forum. <strong>Cyber-Commons Classrooms: Teaching and Learning Spaces beyond the traditional Multimedia Classroom</strong> discusses how EVL has been enhancing classroom spaces with increasingly large digital walls and touchscreens in more then 35 local and distance learning classes. This presentation will explore how display-enhanced spaces may provide opportunities to improve the way people teach, learn, and work together to solve problems in the future.
