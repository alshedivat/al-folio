<strong>SpiderSense</strong> is a UIC prototype wearable suit that enables users to sense (without seeing) obstacles around them. Like the comic book character Spider-Man whose skin tingles at approaching danger, SpiderSense augments human ability - it can potentially help a visually impaired person or a first responder navigate their environments.<br><br>

SpiderSense is garnering a lot of publicity from the media since the research paper &ldquo;Sensing the environment through SpiderSense&rdquo; was presented by Victor Mateevitsi, a PhD candidate in the UIC Computer Science Department and a Research Assistant in the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), at the 4th Augmented Human International Conference in Stuttgart, Germany, held in March 2013. The paper was co-authored by Mateevitsi, Brad Haggadone (UIC Communications), Jason Leigh and Robert Kenyon (UIC Computer Science, Electronic Visualization Laboratory), and Brian Kunzer (UIC Bioengineering, Neural Engineering Vision Laboratory).<br><br>

In February 2013, we reported that several media outlets did stories about SpiderSense. Since then, the list continues to grow, from the sublime (see <strong>Discovery Channel Canada</strong>) to the absurd (see <strong>popCultured</strong>). Most recently, SpiderSense is featured in the April 9, 2013 issue of UIC NEWS <strong><a href="http://news.uic.edu/spidersense-suit-turns-science-fiction-into-reality">With student invention, not seeing is believing</a></strong>, by Matt O&rsquo;Connor, April 9, 2013.<br><br>

A list of publications in which SpiderSense has been featured to date can be found at the end of the article <strong><a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=4&amp;indi=844">Spidey-sense suit tingles when someone gets too close</a></strong>.
Graduate student Alex Simes tests out the &ldquo;SpiderSense&rdquo; suit.
