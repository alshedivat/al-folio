This exhibition and related screenings examine how home is perceived within a socially diverse, multi-cultural society. Given the global scale of political unrest, this project questions collective and individual concepts of home and how these relate to concerns of comfort, stability, and security. The exhibition and screenings explore the domestic but also address concepts of a surrounding discourse that include social and cultural identity, immigration, economic status, gender definition, and ethnic heritage. <em>Home Work/s</em> features artwork by current students, faculty, staff, and alumni of the School. Home Work/s is juried and curated by Linda Dolack, Jin Soo Kim, and Cheri Reif Naselli.<br><br>
