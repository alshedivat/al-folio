<a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=1&amp;indi=286">synthecology</a> combines the possibilities of tele-immersive collaboration with a new architecture for virtual reality sound immersion to create a environment where musicians from all locations can interactively perform and create sonic environments.<br><br>

<strong>COLLABORATORS</strong><br>
synthecology is being created as a collaboration of students and faculty from the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and Columbia College Chicago, through the Applied Interactives organization.<br><br>

<strong>ABOUT APPLIED INTERACTIVES</strong><br>
