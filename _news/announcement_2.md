<strong>Hosted Event.</strong> In conversation with Kevis Goodman

***
The STS Working Group invites you to an upcoming proseminar entitled “Pathologies of Motion: Historical Thinking in Medicine, Aesthetics and Poetics,” featuring Professor Kevis Goodman, Professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley.

Professor Goodman will be discussing her forthcoming book, *Pathologies of Motion* (Yale, 2022) as a way to open up larger questions of the ambiguous "and" in "science and literature" – how does one study them in a way that doesn't just involve analogy, or shared themes? What do these questions look like when one is studying these texts at a moment when "science" and "literature" were not, in fact, different disciplines?

> The basic question I want to raise concerns how our understanding of aesthetics and poetics... might change when we consider them not in terms of medicine’s healing aspirations and palliative adjustments but in terms of the work of pathology... where medical pathology was the knowledge of the multiple conditions of existence in their sensuous or surface effects.
> —Kevis Goodman from *Pathologies of Motion*

The seminar will take place via Zoom on Thursday, November 24 from 2:00 – 4:00pm. Graduate students, advanced undergraduates, and faculty are all welcome to attend.
