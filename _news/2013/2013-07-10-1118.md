The cover of the July 2013 issue of <a href="http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad">Physics Today</a>, a publication of the American Institute of Physics, features a photograph of the CAVE2&trade; neuroscience application developed by the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) in partnership with the UIC Bioengineering Department&rsquo;s Laboratory for Product and Process Design and the University of Illinois Hospital &amp; Health Sciences System&rsquo;s Department of Neurosurgery.<br><br>

The &ldquo;About the Cover&rdquo; description credits the Electronic Visualization Laboratory, University of Illinois at Chicago, and states: &ldquo;This simulation of the brain&rsquo;s blood vessels and cortical tissue, created from magnetic resonance imaging data, exemplifies how physics contributes to 21st-century biology. Increasingly, the life-sciences community is recognizing that its students will need a multidisciplinary, quantitative education&hellip;&rdquo; The description then references one of the journal&rsquo;s articles on &ldquo;Reinventing physics for life-sciences majors,&rdquo; though the CAVE2 image is not associated with the story.<br><br>

When contacted about how he came to use this image, the editor-in-chief of Physics Today said it was made available by the <a href="http://nsf.gov/news/mmg/mmg_disp.cfm?med_id=73535&amp;from=search_list">National Science Foundation on its website</a>.<br><br>

EVL is surprised and delighted about the publicity!
