## Burning Aluminum Nanoparticles for use in Fuel Cells

This CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment simulation depicts the burning of three aluminum nanoparticles at very high temperatures (approximately 2000 C) in order to study their potential use in fuel cells. Visualization by Michael Papka of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) at Argonne National Laboratory and Khairi Reda of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Simulation and data provided by Kenichi Nomura and Priya Vashishta of the University of Southern California. EVL&rsquo;s OmegaLib software is used to display the 3D model in the CAVE2.<br><br>

<em>Note: This dataset cannot be visualized in real time, but EVL has a pre-rendered movie of it.</em><br><br>
