This past semester, three Chicago elementary-school students have been apprentices at the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), developing their own project in the CAVE2&trade; and learning what a career in computer science could be like. A story in the November 19, 2013 issue of UIC NEWS profiles how four EVL graduate students mentored these children, and helped them develop a virtual-reality video game based on Fruit Ninja. Each student designed and created virtual 3-D objects, including a house an airplane a chair a banana and a pizza. In the game, each player gets points for slashing his rival&rsquo;s objects and loses points if he hits his own. The computer science grad students and middle schoolers were matched by Spark Chicago, an organization that places students from underserved areas into hands-on apprenticeships with volunteer mentors.<br><br>
