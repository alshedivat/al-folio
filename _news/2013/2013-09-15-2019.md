The International Space Station (ISS) and Space Shuttle Discovery is a CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment simulation where participants can explore the Space Station in full scale, orbiting the Earth at the current location and altitude of the ISS. Users experience the current field of view from ISS and the territory over which it is orbiting. The ISS orbits the Earth roughly once every 90 minutes at an altitude of 420 km. Participants can fly around the space station and the shuttle to get a better sense of their size in relationship to the shuttle. The model of the ISS and position data come from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The model of the shuttle comes from the google sketchup 3D Warehouse. The earth is rendered using <a href='http://osgearth.org'>osgearth</a>. EVL&rsquo;s OmegaLib software is used to display the 3D models in the CAVE2 System.
