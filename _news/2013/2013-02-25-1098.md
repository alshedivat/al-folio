Victor Mateevitsi, a PhD candidate in the UIC Computer Science Department and a Research Assistant in the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), has received a lot of press in the past few days for &ldquo;SpiderSense,&rdquo; a prototype wearable suit that enables users to sense (without seeing) obstacles around them.<br><br>
 
Like the comic book character Spider-Man whose skin tingles at approaching danger, SpiderSense augments human ability - it can potentially help a pedestrian &ldquo;see&rdquo; hidden dangers, help a fireman entering smoke-filled buildings, or help a visually impaired person navigate his environment. SpiderSense consists of sensor modules, strategically placed on the wearer&rsquo;s body, and uses ultrasound to scan the environment for obstacles within 60 feet which it then translates into tactile signals that stimulate the wearer&rsquo;s skin.<br><br>

Mateevitsi authored the research paper <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=3&amp;indi=474">&ldquo;Sensing the environment through SpiderSense&rdquo;</a> with Brad Haggadone (UIC Communications Department), Jason Leigh and Robert Kenyon (UIC Computer Science, Electronic Visualization Laboratory), and Brian Kunzer (UIC Bioengineering, Neural Engineering Vision Laboratory), which will be presented March 7 at Augmented Human &rsquo;13: the 4th Augmented Human International Conference in Stuttgart, Germany.<br><br>

News of SpiderSense was picked up by New Scientist magazine. Since its article came out, the news has since gone &ldquo;viral,&rdquo; with articles appearing in many places. Below is the list of publications as of 4/9/13:<br><br>

SpiderSense (previously called NinjaVision) is an outgrowth of the UIC Human Augmentics course that was developed and taught in Spring 2012 by Jason Leigh and Robert Kenyon. The course is again offered this semester. Human Augmentics refers to a new interdisciplinary field of study aimed at the research and development of technologies to expand the capabilities and characteristics of humans.<br><br>
