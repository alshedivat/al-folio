On Tuesday, April 23, 2013, the WTTW television news show &ldquo;Chicago Tonight&rdquo; aired an ~8 minute &ldquo;Scientific Chicago&rdquo; segment on the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) and its CAVE2&trade; System.<br><br>

Reporter Ash-har Quraishi showcased EVL&rsquo;s collaboration with UIC BioEngineering and the College of Medicine&rsquo;s Department of Neurosurgery to study the vasculature of the brain, as well as a new collaboration with the Department of Psychiatry on visualizing connectomes; i.e., comprehensive maps of neural connections in the brain. Additional applications by EVL and its collaborators were also highlighted.<br><br>
