In this application, participants view a number of 2D high-resolution images captured by the Mars Curiosity Rover, along side a 3-dimensional model of Mars in the CAVE2&trade;. EVL&rsquo;s SAGE&trade; (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment) software is used to display the images in the CAVE2.<br><br>

As the CAVE2 System is a hybrid environment, it enables users to display both 2D and stereo images, as well as 3D models using SAGE software. This functionality is in particularly useful for information analysis and insight.<br><br>

The data used in this application is from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and California Institute of Technology.
