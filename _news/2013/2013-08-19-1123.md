August 19, 2013 - the National Science Foundation (NSF) &ldquo;Science Nation&rdquo; online magazine features both an article and video about the CAVE2&trade; System developed by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago.<br><br>

<strong><a href="http://science360.gov/obj/video/f4a9db5d-e84c-44e4-a47c-00bd661c81c9/cave2-immerses-scientists-engineers-research-literally">CAVE2 immerses scientists and engineers in their research - literally!</a></strong> is both a video and print story.<br><br>

In addition to interviews with EVL principals Jason Leigh and Andy Johnson, the video also features interviews with EVL collaborators Olusola Ajilore of the UIC Department of Psychiatry and Peter Doran of the UIC Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, both of whom are regular users of the CAVE2 system. Ajilore is studying connectomes - i.e., the neural connections in the brain - in order to better understand depression. Doran is part of a NASA-funded planetary science project that is studying 3D biogeochemical information in extreme terrestrial environments analogous to those found on other planets.<br><br>

The story promotes not only EVL&rsquo;s CAVE2 environment, but also its SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment) software.<br><br>

Note: The NSF Science Nation website links to an article NSF wrote in December 2012, titled <strong><a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=126209">State-of-the-Art Virtual Reality System Is Key to Medical Discovery</a></strong>. That story featured EVL&rsquo;s CAVE2 collaboration with the UIC Bioengineering Department&rsquo;s Laboratory for Product and Process Design and the University of Illinois Hospital &amp; Health Sciences System&rsquo;s Department of Neurosurgery.
