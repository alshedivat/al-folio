Hyejung Hur presents her research and development of a multi-user window management system designed for large tiled display walls as part of her PhD preliminary exam Monday, May 6, 2013.<br><br>

Large high-resolution wall-scale displays come in a wide variety based on their physical configuration. The displays have the common potential to increase the quantity of displayed information. Current usages are primarily limited to presentation and visualization demonstrations. As a workspace, people have problems of being physically larger. For example, people feel more difficult to navigate along with additional screen space, and people can be easily frustrated and confused. To overcome problems and take full advantage of the large displays, many researchers investigate to find the better interaction and better design.<br><br>

Hur proposes a Semi-Automated Smart Arrangement Tool for Distributed Hybrid Large Displays. It is multi-user window management on wall-scale large displays. The proposed research will provide semi-automated smart arrangement to use the wall space easily and effectively. Like desktop window management, it supports for user to move and resize window manually. However, the proposed research is focused on that window agent determines the best position and size for a window according to which window a user is interested in and where the user is. Window agents has their behavior rules and desires to accomplish. The goal of window agent is to find the best fit among agents that have different desires with current task type. To achieve better and easier space organization, additionally  I propose to have space ownership and provide task-based workspace template.<br><br>

The goal of the proposed research is to provide improved window navigation and manipulation, effective use of large space, guideline about how to use large space, and the way to move to collaborative workspace with large display.
