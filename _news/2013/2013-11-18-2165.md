Developed by EVL PhD Candidate Arthur Nishimoto the CAVE2/Unity simulator is a Unity3D package for testing and development of Unity3D applications for the CAVE2&trade; Hybrid-Reality Environment.  Using only standard Unity features (no platform-dependent libraries or Unity Professional license required), this package acts as a wrapper around the CAVE2 API to simulate the CAVE2 viewport and 3D spatial wand interactions on a desktop/laptop development environment.<br><br>
The associated <a href="https://github.com/arthurnishimoto/module-omicron">module-omicron package</a> also serves as the Unity/C# interface of accessing the omicron input abstraction library.
