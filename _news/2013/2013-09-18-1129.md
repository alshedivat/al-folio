PCWorld&rsquo;s sister publication TechHive (1.2 million monthly unique visitors) published the story &ldquo;The art of numbers: Who knew Big Data could look so cool?&rsquo; on September 18, 2013.<br><br>

Jason Leigh, director of the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), is quoted on the need for visualization of Big Data. The article highlights the EVL CAVE2&trade; neuroscience application in which scientists explore a 3D map of neural connections in the brain (called connectomes) based on data taken from an MRI scan.<br><br>

The story&rsquo;s author, Narasu Rebbapragada, followed up with email to EVL saying &ldquo;I became fascinated with this topic while working the story, so please stay in touch on your future projects.&rdquo;<br><br>
