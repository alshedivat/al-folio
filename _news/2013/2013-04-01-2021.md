A connectome is a map of neural connections in the brain. In this CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment application, participants walk inside streamlines depicting the white matter fiber tracts in the brain, derived from diffusion tensor images (DTI) obtained in an MRI scan. The fiber tracts are color-coded by their primary direction (green: front-back, red: left-right, blue: up-down). This research is being done by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago in collaboration with Olusola Ajilore, UIC Department of Psychiatry. EVL&rsquo;s OmegaLib software is used to display the 3D model in the CAVE2.<br><br>
