Professor Jason Leigh, Director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory presents the latest research in advance visualization instrumentation design, development and deployment at Monash University, Australia, Monday October 14th.<br><br>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> In 1992 EVL invented the CAVE - that created a paradigm shift in virtual reality away from bulky head-mounted displays to light-weight 3D glasses with images projected on walls. This presentation describes EVL&rsquo;s research in visualization instrumentation since the CAVE, and how these advanced visualization instruments are used everyday for research and education around the world.<br><br>

<strong>Speaker biography:</strong> Jason Leigh is a Professor of Computer Science and Director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory and the Software Technologies Research Center at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Currently he is a Fellow of the Institute for Health Research and Policy. He has also held appointments at Argonne National Laboratory, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. His research expertise includes: large scale data visualization; virtual reality; high performance networking; and video game design. In 2010 he initiated a new multi-disciplinary area of research called Human Augmentics - which refers to the study of technologies for expanding the capabilities and characteristics of humans. His work has received widespread press from media including: the New York Times, Popular Science&rsquo;s Future Of, Nova ScienceNow, and NSF Science Now. Leigh also teaches classes in Software Design and he has been teaching Video Game Design for over 10 years.<br><br>

A CAVE2&trade; Open House follows the presentation showcasing Monash University&rsquo;s latest large-scale research facility, a hybrid 2D / 3D visualisation space with 80 screens and over 82 million pixels.<br><br>

Location: Room 3.34, Level 3, New Horizons (Building 82), Clayton Campus.
