On May 23, 2013, WTTW (Channel 11) television's news show, "Chicago Tonight," aired the story "The Star Wars Connection" by reporter Ash-har Quraishi. It profiles the involvement of EVL faculty, students and visiting artist Larry Cuba in making the computer graphics special effects for the 1977 Star Wars movie, which premiered 36 years ago this month. It also fast forwards to present day, and how the "Force" continues to inspire the next-generation EVL faculty, staff and students.<br><br>
