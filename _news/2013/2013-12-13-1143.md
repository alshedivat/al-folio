The Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) invites applications for multiple tenure-track faculty positions at all levels, to begin August 2014. All candidates should have (or soon have) a doctorate in Computer Science or a related field and demonstrate significant scholarship in one of the following areas: visualization, computer graphics, human-computer interaction and computer supported cooperative work. Candidates will be expected to carry out world class research, collaborate with faculty from a wide range of disciplines, and teach effectively at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Senior candidates must have an outstanding research record in the computer science topics listed above, a strong record of funded research, demonstrated leadership in collaborative research, and an excellent teaching record at the undergraduate and graduate level.<br><br>

Successful candidates will have the opportunity to become part of the research team at the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL). EVL, established in 1973, represents the oldest formal collaboration between engineering and art in the country, specializing in the design and development of visualization, virtual-reality and collaboration systems utilizing high-performance networks. Recent key projects include SAGE&trade; (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment), the CAVE2&trade; Hybrid Reality Environment, and the TransLight / StarLight project prototyping innovative 100Gb transoceanic services.<br><br>

UIC ranks among the nation&rsquo;s top 50 universities in federal research funding and is ranked the fourth best U.S. university under 50 years old by Times Higher Education. It also is home to the largest medical school in the country. The UIC Computer Science Department is a leading department within the University; it has 24 tenure-track faculty members and offers BS, MS and PhD degrees. It has annual research expenditures of $9.4M, primarily federally funded. The faculty includes two ACM Fellows and nine NSF CAREER award recipients. UIC is an excellent place for interdisciplinary research; Computer Science faculty is engaged in many cross-departmental collaborations with faculty from engineering, health sciences, social sciences, urban planning, education, design, arts, and business.

Chicago epitomizes the modern, livable, vibrant city. Located on the shore of Lake Michigan, it offers an outstanding array of recreational and cultural experiences. As the birthplace of the modern skyscraper, Chicago boasts one of the world&rsquo;s tallest and densest skylines, combined with an extensive system of parks and public transit. Yet the cost of living, whether in an 85th floor condominium downtown or on a tree-lined street in one of the nation&rsquo;s finest school districts, is surprisingly low.<br><br>
