Kapil&rsquo;s presentation will focus on the utility of large displays (i.e. tile display) not only in scientific visualization but also as an emerging technology in the world of art and performances.<br><br>

Kapil will also discuss how creativity shaped itself from stone in the early ages to pixels in today&rsquo;s digital age. Various issues like art, commercial art, new media, and mass media will also be addressed in the presentation.
