This application models the pouring of a fluidity spiral used to measure the distance metal can flow in a channel before being stopped by solidification. The gray iron at 1395 degrees C is poured into the mold for two seconds and flows down the spiral arm turning to mush at 1215 degrees C and solidifying at 1150 degrees C. The casting then continues to lose heat to the mold until solidification is complete.<br><br>

The calculations were performed using the Casting Process Simulator (CaPS), robust multidimensional time-dependent computer code that uses a finite-volume formulation in solving mass, momentum, and energy equations, and performs mold filling and solidification
