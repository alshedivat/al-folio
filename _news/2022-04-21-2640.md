Long-time EVLer and PhD candidate Arthur Nishimoto has been recognized by the UIC College of Engineering with the 2022 Exceptional Research Promise Award.  Arthur began his work with EVL in 2009 as a Research Experience Undergraduate developing virtual reality and visualization applications for collaborative research between EVL and NASA.  After graduating with his bachelorette degree, Arthur pursued a MS in computer science with focus on advanced visualization, virtual reality and real-time interactive application development.  Since 2014, Arthur has been working towards his PhD (expected Summer 2022), has been an incredibly prolific and valued member of EVL.  Arthur is well-deserving of this honor.  We look forward to seeing him continue his exceptional research over his career.
