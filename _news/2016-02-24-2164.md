Wallcology, an extension of the &rsquo;Embedded Phenomena&rsquo; learning technology framework, can be described as a computer simulation designed to support middle school curricular goals in life science and population ecology. By situating students within a complex virtual ecosystem, this system allows them to conduct investigations focused on topics such as the identification and classification of species, predator-prey relationships, food webs and others. Kyle Almryde presents his contribution to this research project, and discusses some of the design rationale and classroom experience surrounding this ubiquitous computing application.<br><br>
This work is part of a collaboration between two programs of research known as EPIC (Embedded Phenomena for Knowledge Communities). The EP framework was developed by Tom Moher and the Learning Technologies Group at UIC. The Knowledge Community and Inquiry model is being investigated by Jim Slotta and his students at the Encore Lab at OISE/UT. In EPIC classrooms, students work together as active members of a knowledge community, sharing information, reasoning together, and solving problems.
