Josephine Lipuma presents an overview of the OUTVIDEO :: International video_art festival in public spaces, Ekaterinburg, Russia, May 5 - June 5, 2004.<br><br>

The idea of the festival was to integrate contemporary video art into the public spaces of Ekaterinburg, Russia. The festival public screenings happened on outdoor video screens on the network of &ldquo;IgRek Cinema&rdquo; company, where 10 city screens were located in the most busy spots. The video art works were shown during one month each day in the pauses between commercial blocks, altogether around 240 screenings per day. This presentation is about the documentation of the festival. I will present the festival dvd, and we will get an overview of the international works which were juried in the international competion. My work, <em>eternal joy: no words</em>, was chosen to  be in the permanent collection of the NATIONAL CENTER FOR CONTEMPORARY ART Ekaterinburg, Russia with all the other works  which I will present at the seminar.
