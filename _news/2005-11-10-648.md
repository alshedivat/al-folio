Drew Browning (School of Art and Design, University of Illinois at Chicago) and Annette Barbier (Columbia College Chicago) will co-present &ldquo;Wave Harmonies&rdquo; in which they will demonstrate and discuss the foundational concepts of an interactive installation originally commissioned by the Museum of Science and Industry. Wave Harmonies engages the audience - individual interactor or group of participants - in the creation and manipulation of waveforms displayed as Lissajous figures. Lissajous figures are graphic representations of the interaction of two periodic waveforms. If frequencies are equal to or multiples of one another, they produce visual harmonics resulting in organized patterns. In our interpretation of this principle, the audience uses colored cards to control the horizontal and vertical motion of a point moving on a screen. Fundamental to the concept and function of this work are ideas of the body as both subject and method of control; human agency, both individual and group; and making the invisible visible.
Still from &ldquo;Wave Harmonies&rdquo;
