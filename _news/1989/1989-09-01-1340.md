This paper discusses (1) the computer graphics transformations necessary to produce source images for barrier-strip autostereograms, and (2) current research to replace photographic processes with computational processes to combine different views into a stereogram. By connecting a computer to a high-resolution output scanner, computer-based images and digitized camera images can automatically be combined and printed on transparency film. Automating this process improves the visual quality of the autostereograms and expands the medium&rsquo;s commercial and artistic potential.
