  <!-- **Paper to appear at ICML 2022.** Generalized linear models (GLMs) with categorical outcomes can be tough to fit in Bayesian fashion, especially when number of categories are large. We define a new class of categorical GLMs for which approximate Bayesian inference is simple, fast, and scalable. Our approach scales to thousands of categories, outperforming posterior estimation competitors like Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) and No U-Turn Sampling (NUTS) in the time required to achieve fixed prediction quality. -->
