Dynamic network visualization has been a challenging topic for dynamic networks analysis, especially for spatially embedded networks like brain networks.  In this paper, we present an animated interactive visualization design that combines enhanced node-link diagrams and distance matrix layouts to assist neuroscientists in their exploration of dynamic brain networks and that enables them to understand how functional connections relate to the spatial structure of the brain.  Our visualization also provides the ability to observe the evolution of a network, the change in the community identities, and node behavior over time.
