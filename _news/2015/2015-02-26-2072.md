Victor Mateevitsi is one of the speakers participating in this evening’s Innovation U, which is part of Chicago Inno&rsquo;s Winter Event Series, Polar Vor-Tech, organized in partnership with the Chicago Innovation Exchange. The Thursday, February 26, 2015 meet-up event spotlights Illinois university-based entrepreneurial-focused centers and initiatives. This event is SOLD OUT, indicating both the popularity of this series and the interest in the subject matter.<br><br>
Mateevitsi, a UIC Computer Science PhD student and Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) research assistant, will talk about his &ldquo;SpiderSense&rdquo; research project - a wearable suit that detects when the user is nearing another person, tree, door, or any other obstacle. He is one of a dozen speakers from startups and/or innovations being launched by local universities or run by students and post-grads. Other universities represented include University of Chicago, Northwestern, and Notre Dame.<br><br>
