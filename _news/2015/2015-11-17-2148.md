<strong>SAGE2&trade;: Scalable Amplified Group Environment for Global Collaboration Birds of a Feather (BOF)</strong><br><br>
Tuesday, November 17<br>
12:15PM - 01:15PM<br>
Room: 13A<br><br>
SAGE2 is an innovative user-centered platform for small groups or large distributed teams to share and investigate large-scale datasets on tiled display systems in order to glean insights and discoveries. SAGE2 treats these displays as a seamless ultra-high-resolution desktop, enabling users to co-locate data from various sources and juxtapose content. SAGE2 was announced at SC14 last year; it is the next-generation SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment), which has been the defacto operating system for managing Big Data content on tiled display walls, providing the scientific community with persistent visualization and collaboration services for global cyberinfrastructure.<br><br>
This BOF provided a Forum for SAGE2 developers to meet with the the SAGE/SAGE2 global user community and potential users; specifically:<br><br>
- to introduce key SAGE2 team members<br>
- to highlight SAGE2 research and education applications<br>
- to review SAGE2 capabilities and applications<br>
- to provide an overview of the SAGE2 roadmap<br><br>
In addition, SAGE2 demonstrations took place in the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) research booth on the exhibition floor, November 17-19, 2015.<br><br>
