SAGE, the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment, is the defacto operating system for managing Big Data content on scalable-resolution tiled display walls, providing the scientific community with persistent visualization and collaboration services for global cyberinfrastructure. SAGE2, the next-generation SAGE, is a wholly new implementation of SAGE using state-of-the-art web and cloud technologies. SAGE2 better addresses the needs of contemporary collaborative projects, and has the potential to expand the SAGE user community because of its enhanced support for development and integration of multi-user applications and lower barrier to entry.
