Scott Barrows, Director of Simulation Programming at the Jump Trading Simulation &amp; Education Center in Peoria, Illinois presents his team&rsquo;s development of medical simulations and interactive education.<br><br>
This presentation will introduce participants to the active development of medical simulation and interactive education at one of the leading simulation centers in the world. At the Jump Center, innovation is successfully implemented into the reality of the current health care system. Simulation in health care serves to train, educate, and provide insight into the challenges and opportunities for improvement in process and product technology.<br><br> 
Medical and healthcare education has changed dramatically over the last 25 years. As a piece of the healthcare &ldquo;triple aim&rdquo; (improve the health of the defined population, enhance the patient care experience, and reduce the per capita cost of care), medical simulation is an essential piece of best practices in medical and healthcare education.<br><br>
