Thanks to a major research infrastructure grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the University of Hawai&rsquo;i (UH) will be home to one of the best data visualization systems in the United States. The award to Jason Leigh, a Computer and Information Science Professor and Founder and Director of the Laboratory for Advanced Visualization and Applications (LAVA) at the University of Hawai&rsquo;i at MƒÅnoa (UHM), is to build a state-of-the-art data visualization and virtual-reality system across 10 Hawai&rsquo;i campuses. Leigh got his PhD in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and is a Director Emeritus of the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL).<br><br>
NSF provided $600,000 and UH added $257,000 for a total of $857,000 to develop the CyberCANOE, which stands for Cyber-enabled Collaboration Analysis Navigation and Observation Environment. The CyberCANOE is a visualization and collaboration infrastructure that will enable students and researchers to work together more effectively using large amounts of data and information.<br><br>
The new CyberCANOE, which is expected to be built in about three years, will enable Leigh&rsquo;s visualization laboratory to provide scientific communities with highly integrated, visually rich collaboration environments; to work with industry to facilitate the creation of new technologies for the advancement of science and engineering; and, to continue ongoing partnerships with many of the world&rsquo;s best scientists in academia and industry. With the CyberCANOE, the lab will also support the country&rsquo;s leadership position in high-performance computing and in contributing advancements to complex global issues, such as the environment, health and the economy.<br><br>
