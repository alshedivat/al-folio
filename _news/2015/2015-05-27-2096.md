Northwestern University postdoctoral research associate, Steve Haroz presents his research in brain perception of visual information at EVL.<br><br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
Although the infographic and design communities have used simple pictographic representations for decades, it is still unclear whether they can make visualizations more effective.  Using simple charts, we tested how pictographic representations impact (1) memory for information just viewed, as well as under the load of additional information, (2) speed of finding information, and (3) engagement and preference in seeking out these visualizations.  We find that superfluous images can distract.  But we find no user costs - and some intriguing benefits - when pictographs are used to represent the data.<br><br>
<strong>Bio:</strong><br>
Steve Haroz researches how the brain perceives and selects visual information.  His goal is to use an understanding of the human visual system to inform visualization guidelines.  He is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Psychology Department at Northwestern University.
