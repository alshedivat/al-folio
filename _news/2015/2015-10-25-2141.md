The week of October 25, 2015, the international IEEE Visualization (VIS) 2015 conference is being held in downtown Chicago, and the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), part of the Computer Science (CS) department at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has a leadership role in helping ensure its success.<br><br>
EVL director Maxine Brown serves as General Co-chair with Michael E. Papka of Argonne National Laboratory (who is also a CS/EVL alumnus). EVL CS faculty G. Elisabeta Marai is co-chair of the Doctoral Colloquium. EVL CS faculty Angus Forbes and EVL School of Design faculty Daria Tsoupikova are co-chairs of the Arts Program (VISAP). EVL director of research and CS faculty Andy Johnson serves on the Program Committees of the Scientific Visualization (SciVis) and VISAP tracks. EVL senior research scientist and director emeritus Dan Sandin is participating in VISAP as an invited artist and panelist.<br><br>
EVL CS students are also participating. Jillian Aurisano and Tim Luciano are serving as Student Volunteers. Aurisano also has two accepted posters: &ldquo;Show Me Data,&rdquo; which received an honorable mention, is about a conversational interface in visual data exploration that is being done with CS advisor Andy Johnson and professor Barbara Di Eugenio; and, &ldquo;AlignmentVis: Visual Analytics for Ontology Matching,&rdquo; which describes her work from the Data and Web Semantics course taught by professor Isabel Cruz. Angus Forbes&rsquo; student Alessandro Chetta is presenting a paper in the Workshop on Visual Analytics in Health Care. Forbes&rsquo; student Kyle Almryde received honorable mention in the SciVis Data Contest for his web-based 3D visualization application entitled &ldquo;Halos in a Dark Sky: Interactively Exploring the Structure of Dark Matter Halo Merger Trees.&rdquo;<br><br>
In addition to the above, many EVL alumni are also involved in organizing this conference, and many more will be attending the one week event. The UIC CS department is one of the sponsors.<br><br>

<strong>2015 IEEE Visualization Conference Connects Latest in Research to Real World Practice</strong><br><br>
CHICAGO, 12 October 2015 - Over a thousand data visualization specialists are expected at the 2015 IEEE Visualization (VIS) conference in Chicago this month. For one week starting October 25, VIS will host the largest annual gathering of academics, practitioners, and researchers focused on making every variety of dataset visually understandable.<br><br>
After its successful meeting in Paris last year, the international VIS conference is returning to the United States, where organizers hope to attract a record number of young practitioners seeking opportunities to meet and mingle with the senior members and leaders in their field. This year&rsquo;s program includes several returning events aimed at encouraging such interactions, such as the Doctoral Colloquium and Digital Compass activities, along with a new industry-targeted Practitioner Event.<br><br> 
<ldquo;This conference is the best opportunity all year for the data visualization community to see and share the latest advancements, tools, and techniques,rdquo; said Michael E. Papka, VIS 2015 co-chair. &ldquo;From the academic to the applied, VIS has something to offer everybody working in the field today.&rdquo;<br><br>
VIS 2015 papers talks and panels are organized into three tracks: Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST), Information Visualization (InfoVis), and Scientific Visualization (SciVis). These main track offerings and a three-day exhibition begin on Tuesday October 27. Three co-located symposiums are held on the first two days of VIS 2015: Visualization in Data Science (VDS), Large Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV), and Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec). The VIS offerings on Sunday October 25 and Monday October 26 also include eight workshops and nine tutorials.<br><br>
The VIS 2015 Arts Program features a papers track and a two-week public art exhibition at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago&rsquo;s (SAIC’s) LeRoy Neiman Center, which is located across the street from the conference venue, the Palmer House Hilton, in Chicago&rsquo;s downtown Loop district.<br><br>
IEEE VIS is sponsored by IEEE’s Computer Society. Additional support comes from academic, industry, and government research organizations. <a href="http://ieeevis.org">Register and learn more about the conference program</a>.
