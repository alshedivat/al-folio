Victor Mateevitsi, a University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) PhD student in the Computer Science (CS) Department and the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), applied to Microsoft Research for a 2015 summer internship to work on virtual and augmented reality systems. Selected, he worked in Jaron Lanier&rsquo;s lab; Lanier is a highly regarded computer scientist, writer and composer, who pioneered virtual and augmented reality in the 1980s. Lanier is researching multi-person mixed reality - i.e., enabling more than one person to interact with the same virtual object or phenomenon at the same time.<br><br>
Mateevitsi, whose PhD advisor is CS Associate Professor and EVL Director of Research Andy Johnson, is interested in Human Augmentics and Sensory Augmentation; i.e., how wearable technologies and body sensors affect people&rsquo;s perception of the world around them and, more specifically, how these devices can improve one&rsquo;s awareness in complex environments.<br><br>
Given his interest in wearable technologies, the opportunity to work on augmented reality at Microsoft Research for the summer, particularly under the tutelage of a luminary in the field, was a wonderful opportunity. Mateevitsi worked on applications with interns from Stanford University, MIT Media Lab, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Georgia Tech, and other notable institutions.<br><br>
Lanier&rsquo;s project is called Comradre (pronounced &ldquo;comradery&rdquo;). Headsets were made using smartphones and laptop computers, and the tracking of a person&rsquo;s head movements were performed using external sensors. Mateevitsi worked with a small group to create a system that allowed sound waves to be detected and then shown visually. In one scene from the group&rsquo;s video, the sound produced by Lanier&rsquo;s flute playing was shown in mixed reality.<br><br>
To learn more about how researchers in Lanier&rsquo;s lab at Microsoft Research are exploring ways for people to share experiences in mixed reality, see the October 12, 2015 article <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/542341/microsoft-researchers-are-working-on-multi-person-virtual-reality/">&ldquo;Microsoft Researchers Are Working on Multi-Person Virtual Reality&rdquo;</a> by Will Night, published in the MIT Technology Review.
This example of shared mixed reality shows two students both seeing a visual effect as they shake hands.
