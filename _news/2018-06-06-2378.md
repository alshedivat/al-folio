JUNE 6, 2018 - Maxine Brown, Director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) in the department of Computer Science at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), is a &ldquo;Perennial&rdquo; - the name given to individuals who have had perfect attendance in the 30-year history of the IEEE/ACM Supercomputing (SC) professional conference. One of 17 people with this distinction, Brown is profiled with the other Perennials in the latest SC Blog, titled &ldquo;30 Years - and the Journey Continues: Perspectives from the SC Perennials.&rdquo;<br><br>
Though this year marks the official 30th anniversary of the SC conference, 2018 actually marks the Perennials&rsquo; 31st consecutive attendance. The first conference was held in 1988 in Orlando, Florida, with fewer than 1,500 attendees, while this year&rsquo;s event in Dallas, Texas, is expected to attract 11,000 international participants. Over the years, the conference has also broadened its scope, from being supercomputer-centric to being about high-performance computing, networking, storage and analysis.<br><br>
In 1988, Brown had been at UIC for two years and was EVL&rsquo;s Associate Director. She had approached the chair of this fledgling conference to propose they hold a Visualization Theater, showcasing films and videos from researchers who used computer graphics to visualize complex data from supercomputers and instruments; and, when the chair enthusiastically agreed, she organized and hosted it. EVL also had a research booth with collaborator Ellen Sandor of (Art)n Laboratory to display &ldquo;phscolograms&rdquo; (auto-stereo 3D images) of scientific and mathematical images, in order to meet potential collaborators.<br><br>
As Brown mentions in the SC Blog article, her fondest memory of early SC conferences was attendee enthusiasm for the CAVE&trade; Virtual Reality Theater, which was invented by EVL and premiered at a different conference in the summer of 1992. SC folks saw it, and requested EVL bring it to SC92 in Minneapolis, and then again to SC93 in Portland - and again to SC95 in San Diego!<br><br>
Brown, and EVL, continue to be active in SC conferences, participating in the large research exhibition, most recently demonstrating the lab&rsquo;s SAGE2 collaboration software (a joint project of UIC and University of Hawaii at Manoa), and holding SAGE2 Birds-of-a-Feather sessions to meet with its global user community.<br><br>
