<em>Dan Sandin may be Co-founder and Director Emeritus of the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) and Professor Emeritus of the UIC School of Art &amp; Design, but his retirement is simply a &ldquo;repriorment&rdquo; as he spends more time creating interactive art and advanced display technologies. Sandin&rsquo;s past and present accomplishments and his philosophy of art and what motivates him are nicely explained in a human interest story written by a science journalism graduate student from Northwestern University&rsquo;s Medill School.</em><br><br>
