My Ph.D. is nearing its end and I'll have the opportunity to present my research to the wider community.

I'll be introducing _"A Decoupled Framework for Fast and High-Resolution Simulations of Annual Outdoor Thermal Comfort"_

Cities will experience a substantial increase in extreme weather events as global warming
continues, thereby affecting the microclimate they create for their citizens. The micro
climate in cities is shaped by the built environment, proposed and developed by architects
and urban designers, and constrained by the zoning rules imposed by urban planners.
These stakeholders go through a design process where the most impactful changes can
only be made very early on; however, there are currently no computational tools to
estimate the microclimatic impact of their designs at this crucial stage.
<br>
This thesis introduces a decoupled approach to simulating outdoor thermal comfort
motivated by global sensitivity analyses. For this, we streamline and validate computational
fluid dynamics and ray tracing processes needed to simulate the wind velocity and mean
radiant temperature in urban areas. We further introduce a surrogate model driven by
a generative adversarial network that allows for near-instantaneous design feedback in
very early design.
<br>
In three case studies, we show how the methods can be used in practice at different
scales: (1) to engage in building-scale architectural design, (2) run parametric studies
and optimization for urban design, (3) and inform city-scale urban policy. We conclude
by providing an outlook on how the latest machine learning techniques will likely be
applied to the field of architecture, revolutionizing the way we engage with environmental
performance simulation in the design process.
