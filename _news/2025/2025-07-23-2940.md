SAGE3, the Smart Amplified Group Environment, is the next-generation, “human-in-the-loop” visualization and collaboration platform, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to serve as a user’s “co-pilot” to autonomously manage and link disparate datasets and orchestrate services. It is being developed by the Laboratory for Advanced Visualization & Applications (LAVA) and the Hawaii Data Science Institute (HI-DSI) at University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM), the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), and the Center for Human-Computer Interaction (CHCI) at Virginia Tech (VT).

SAGE3 held its annual AHM at EVL from July 23-25, 2025. LAVA, EVL and CHCI team members participated either locally or remotely, and were joined by long-time collaborators Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) at Argonne National Laboratory and the Academy for Creative Media (ACM) at University of Hawaii.<br><br>
Though distributed, the team had fruitful discussions and brainstorming sessions, which were greatly enhanced by using SAGE3 on EVL&rsquo;s Cyber-Commons display wall to share documents, webpages, stickie notes, etc. They also utilized SAGE3&rsqu;s AI capabilities to search online for information, summarize documents, etc. Given this is the last year of the current NSF SAGE3 award, discussions also centered on the future. Topics discussed:<br><br>
* Listing both work to be completed, and aspirations for how SAGE3 can be an even more productive collaboration and visualization tool.<br>
* Discussions of how technology is advancing and what will be important over the next five years.<br>
* Deciding what new user communities might benefit from SAGE3.<br>
* Discussions on how AI can further help with collaboration, documentation, spatialization of content, etc.<br>
* Looking at future opportunities and potential NSF programs to pursue.<br><br>
<i>SAGE3 receives major support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), awards #2004014 (UHM), #2003800 (UIC) and #2003387 (VT).</i>
