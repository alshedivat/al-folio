Congratulations to Francesco Botto and co-authors on their workshop paper being accepted to <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~icdm2025/index.html">Workshop on Computational Gastronomy: Data Science for Food and Cooking at the International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2025</a>.<br><br>
&ldquo;FlavorCharter: Development of a Smartphone App for Quantifying Food Flavor&rdquo;, Francesco Botto, Guadalupe Canhuate, Xinhua Zhang, C. David Fuller, G. Elisabeta Marai, pp. 1-7, Workshop on Computational Gastronomy: Data Science for Food and Cooking (CoGamy) at the International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2025<br><br>
The paper presents a smartphone app to survey people about their perceptions of flavors. It is designed to be easy/fast to use but to cover enough variations of flavors to capture results that are useful for analysis. The app is motivated by the loss of taste experienced by some patients due to various conditions, including cancer.
