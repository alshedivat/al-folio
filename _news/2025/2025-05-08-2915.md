<strong>Motivation:</strong><br>
- The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has created hundreds of petabytes of data. The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will produce orders of magnitude more.
The HL-LHC is a major upgrade to the LHC, aiming to be operational by the end of 2030. It will produce more data in one year than the LHC produced during its first 10 years of operation.<br><br>
- Significant R&D efforts are needed to handle the incoming tide of data. Without using new technologies, the data volume of the HL-LHC will rapidly outgrow CERN&rsquo;s compute and storage capacities. This means everything is on the table, even historically disfavored methods like lossy compression.
