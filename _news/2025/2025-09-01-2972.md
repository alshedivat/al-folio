The rapidly expanding data generated by advanced methods in biology are creating enormous challenges at the interface between humans and biological data that can be represented and analyzed visually. To meet these challenges, a blend of methodology from the visualization, bioinformatics, and biology domains is required. This methodology encompasses perception and design knowledge, algorithm design, techniques for analyzing and visualizing Big Data, statistics, and specific domain knowledge for different application problems. Powerful and integrative visualization methods are necessary, as well as methods for visually communicating the outcome of computational analytical methods and findings. This special issue aims to highlight new challenges in biological data visualization (BioVis) and State-of-the-Art solutions created by the vibrant BioVis community.
