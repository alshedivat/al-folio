Prior uncore frequency tuning studies have primarily focused on conventional HPC workloads running on CPU-only systems. As HPC advances toward heterogeneous computing, integrating diverse GPU workloads on heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems, it becomes imperative to revisit and enhance uncore scaling. Our investigation reveals that uncore frequency scales down only when CPU power approaches its TDP (Thermal Design Power) -- a rare scenario in GPU-dominant applications -- resulting in unnecessary power waste in modern computing systems.
