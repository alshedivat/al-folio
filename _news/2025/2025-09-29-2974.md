&ldquo;ChromPolymerDB: A High-Resolution Database of Single-Cell 3D Chromatin Structures for Functional Genomics&rdquo; authored by Chronis, Constantinos (UIC), Chen, Min (Shanghai Jiao Tong University), Du, Lin (UIC), Zhao, Siyuan (UIC), Ye, Bowei (UIC), Delafrouz, Pourya (UIC), Farooq, Hammad (UIC), Chattopadhyay, Debaleena (UIC), Marai, G. Elisabeta (UIC), Shao, Zhifeng (Shanghai Jiao Tong University), Liang, Jie (UIC), and Czajkowsky, Daniel M (Shanghai Jiao Tong University) has been published in NAR-02636-2025, Nucleic Acids Research, 2025.<br><br>
This work provides a valuable interface and algorithm resource and a database for exploring scHi-C (single-cell Hi-C) data and integrating these analyses into ongoing research. This work stems from a project by Lin Du, advised by Jie Liang. Constantinos Chronis, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at UIC, shepherded the submission after Jie Liang passed away.
Overview of the ChromPolymerDB database.
