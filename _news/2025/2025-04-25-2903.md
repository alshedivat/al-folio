<strong>Smart/Scalable Amplified Group Environment (SAGE3 & SAGE2), Computer Science, Luc Renambot and Jason Leigh (2025).</strong> To think more clearly, ideate more creatively, and reach decisions with speed, accuracy and confidence, people need help working collaboratively and making sense of complex information. <a href="https://sage3.sagecommons.org/">SAGE3</a> provides users with an intuitive framework that integrates state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technologies with applications, workflows, smart visualizations and commercial collaboration services to help teams, both local and remote, access, share, explore and analyze their data. SAGE3 creates a unified platform, whether using laptops, tiled display walls, or rooms with projection technology. New Federal funding in 2020 motivated the UIC development team to take advantage of major technological advancements and the advent of hybrid home/work environments to create SAGE3, the successor to SAGE2, which was introduced in 2013. Several companies licensed SAGE2 and incorporated its concepts and codes in their products for collaboration, visualization, hybrid environments and critical decision making, though have expressed interest in SAGE3. SAGE3 is open source, and anyone can download from its <a href="https://www.sagecommons.org/">website</a> for use . Companies can use internally and can license it for use in products.<br><br>
<i>SAGE3 is a collaborative research project with UIC, University of Hawaii Manoa and Virginia Tech, funded by NSF awards 2003800, 2004014 and 2003387. SAGE, SAGE2 and SAGE3 are trademarks of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.</i><br><br>
