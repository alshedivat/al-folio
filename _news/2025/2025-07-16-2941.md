On July 16, 2025 UIC&rsquo;s Computer Science Department&rsquo;s new building - Computer Design Research and Learning Center (CDRLC) opened at 850 W. Taylor Street.  The 135,000-square-foot building houses EVL&rsquo;s Arcade, also known as the Data Observation and Computation Collaboratory (DOCC).  Arcade is a visual data science instrument for UIC science and engineering research and research training - a digital Project Room that enables domain scientists and computer scientists to collaborate on real-world problems by providing them with high-performance computing, high-resolution displays, and sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI), data analytic, data simulation, image processing, visualization, and virtual-reality software and services.<br><br>
Arcade provides on-site computing with adequate support, and it provides collaboration software services. It is a configurable computing environment that prioritizes real-time, interactive, collaborative, data-intensive applications, but can be scheduled off-hours for batch-mode processing. Users can execute codes faster, apply more sophisticated analytics to large-scale problems, gain greater insights, and open new avenues of research. The Arcade's collaboration software lets researchers either interact locally with colleagues using the display walls or video-teleconference while simultaneously sharing and interacting with their data on the large displays, which remote viewers can also access online.
