&ldquo;Accelerating Graph Rendering in the Web&rdquo; received 2nd place in the 2025 Image of Research Competition in the Moving Images category.  EVL graduate research assistant Landon Dyken, with supervision from assistant professor Sidharth Kumar, developed an application for visualizing graph data that uses new algorithms to allow for fast rendering on the web.<br><br>
The video submission was created by rendering several open-source scientific datasets, along with another created from the UIC logo. A comparison with the previous state-of-the-art methods shows how this method improves performance and enables larger-scale data than previously possible.<br><br>
