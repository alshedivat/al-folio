<strong>You Can Grow Here: A Therapeutic VR Journey for Anxiety Management</strong> is an immersive VR experience developed for the CAVE2&trade; environment, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goal of Good Health and Well-Being. In response to the mental health challenges intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic, the project explores how interactive storytelling, ambient sound, and 3D typography can support emotional reflection and teach anxiety coping strategies. Built in Unity with custom assets from Blender and Maya, the experience differs from most clinical VR programs, allowing users to independently explore emotions, manage anxiety, and practice evidence-based calming techniques within a safe, narrative-driven space that builds emotional resilience.<br><br>
The project was developed by UIC CS+DES students Gaeun Lee, Hope Jo, Cindy Nakhammouane, and CS student Khin Yuupar Myat in the CS/DES 427/450 Creative Coding course, taught by Professors Daria Tsoupikova and Mike Papka with support from TA Hal Brynteson.
