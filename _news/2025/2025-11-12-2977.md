We present the design and development of a crowdsourced, data-driven approach to quantifying the flavor of specific foods. Our approach leverages an interactive smartphone app with a client-server architecture and supports future stratified analysis based on dietary and demographic factors. This approach has the potential to document taste loss and to empower patients to describe taste loss symptoms in a more precise, standardized language.<br><br>
