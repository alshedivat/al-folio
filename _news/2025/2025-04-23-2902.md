[Professor G. Elisabeta Marai](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/g-marai/) has been appointed by the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a> as a chartered member of the <a href="https://public.era.nih.gov/pubroster/roster.era?CID=105251">Clinical Informatics and Digital Health (CIDH) Study Section</a> within the NIH Center for Scientific Review (CSR). Marai&rsquo;s 4 term-year appointment runs from July 2024 through June 2028. The appointment was issued by the CSR Director on behalf of the Director of NIH. This is a tremendous achievement and well-deserved recognition of Marai&rsquo;s leadership role in clinical informatics, digital health and computational approaches to improved health.<br><br>
Chartered membership on an NIH study section represents a major commitment of professional time and energy as well as a unique opportunity to contribute to the national biomedical research effort. Study sections review applications submitted to NIH, make recommendations on the applications to the appropriate NIH national advisory council or board, and survey the status of research in their fields of science. These functions are of great value to the medical and allied research field, serving to advance science for our nation and the world.<br><br>
Marai&rsquo;s appointment letter cites Marai&rsquo;s demonstrated competence and achievement in her scientific discipline as evidenced by the quality of her research accomplishments, publications in scientific journals, and other significant scientific activities, achievements, and honors. It further notes that service on a study section also requires mature judgment and objectivity as well as the ability to work effectively in a group, additional qualities NIH believes Marai will bring to this important task.<br><br>
Marai is the director of graduate admissions for the computer science department, a director of UIC&rsquo;s Institute for Health Data Science Research, and was named a 2023-2026 University Scholar by the University of Illinois System.
