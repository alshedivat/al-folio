EVL&rsquo;s Director (2014-2020) Maxine Brown continues to contribute to the advancement of research innovation as The 6th Global Research Platform (6GRP) Workshop Coordinator with long time EVL collaborator Joe Mambretti (International Center for Advanced Internet Research (iCAIR), Northwestern University) as Workshop Chair.  The Workshop focuses on recent and emerging advances in architectures, services, technologies, and infrastructures driven by the requirements of large-scale, data-intensive, scientific research. Speakers present their innovations and explain how their work supports global science research. The 6GRP Workshop program consists of five themes:<br>
- Large-Scale Global Science<br>
- Next-Generation Research Platforms<br>
- International Testbeds for Data-Intensive Science and the Transition to Tbps-800G-400G WANs<br>
- Global Networking for Science Initiatives<br>
- Enhancements of Major R&E Networks and Open Exchange Points<br><br>
6GRP is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on <a href="https://www.escience-conference.org/2025/">eScience 2025</a>. GRP Workshops and eScience Conferences co-locate because of their similar but complementary goals. Whereas both focus on data- and compute-intensive research across domain sciences, GRP promotes communication strategies for next-generation distributed services and infrastructure.<br><br>
6GRP will be held at the Embassy Suites Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile, Chicago, September 15-16, 2025.
