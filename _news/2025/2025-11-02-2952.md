EVL PhD candidate Hossein Fathollahian has his short paper accepted at the <a href="http://biovis.net/2025/">BioMedVis Challenge 2025</a>, a data contest organized by <a href="https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/welcome">IEEE VIS 2025</a>.<br><br>
H. Fathollahian, S. Zhao, M. Nipu, G.E. Marai, &ldquo;Attention-based Region of Interest Discovery in 3D Tissue Images&rdquo;, IEEE BioMedVis Challenge 2025, IEEE VIS, 2025.<br><br>
This work presents an approach for the detection and exploration of regions of interest (ROIs) using graph-based analysis. The novel computational approach for ROI detection is a main strength, and the interactive frontend includes several features addressing the challenge tasks, such as quick navigation to prominent ROIs.<br><br>
Additionally, Hossein paper &ldquo;From Peaks to Patterns&rdquo; was accepted to the ReDesign Contest:<br><br>
Authors: Hossein Fathollahian, Marziye Salahshour<br><br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> MRS is a non-invasive way of gaining information about cellular metabolism and can be used to study neurological and metabolic disorders. However, the clinical utility is limited by low signal quality, overlapping spectral peaks, and the inability to interpret and compare metabolite data. We developed an interactive visual analysis system that establishes the methods by adding filtering, quality measurement, and a comparative summary of MRS signals. This will allow researchers to perform a more accurate evaluation of spectral data, which will help them understand the molecular processes behind the complex neurological and metabolic processes in greater depth.<br><br>
Congratulations, Hossein!
