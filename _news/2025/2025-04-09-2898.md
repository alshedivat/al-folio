This project leverages the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) to enhance collaborative research through AI-driven immersive analytics, using SAGE3 as the foundational platform. SAGE3 (Smart Amplified Group Environment) is an open-source collaboration tool that integrates real-time information sharing and visualization across devices, from large display walls to mobile laptops. This initiative will augment SAGE3 with advanced AI capabilities, enabling seamless analysis of scientific documents, images, audio, and data. AI features such as automated summarization, visual language processing, and collaborative brainstorming will empower researchers to generate insights and make informed decisions more effectively.
