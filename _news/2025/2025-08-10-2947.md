We are thrilled to announce that CS+DES students Gaeun Lee, Hope Jo, Cindy Nakhammouane, and CS student Khin Yuupar Myat presented their virtual reality project <strong>You Can Grow Here: A Therapeutic VR Journey for Anxiety Management </strong>at <a href="https://s2025.siggraph.org/">ACM SIGGRAPH 2025</a>, held in Vancouver, Canada August 10-14, 2025!<br><br>
This innovative project was developed in the CS/DES 427/450 Creative Coding course, taught by Professors Daria Tsoupikova and Mike Papka with support from TA Hal Brynteson. The work explores the intersection of technology, design, and mental health through a VR experience aimed at anxiety management.<br><br>
ACM SIGGRAPH is the world&rsquo;s premier international conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques, known for its competitive selection process and global prestige. Having undergraduate students accepted to present at SIGGRAPH is a rare and outstanding achievement.<br><br>
Congratulations to our CS+DES students for this remarkable accomplishment and for showcasing the creativity and impact of the CS+DES program on an international stage!
