Bottom‐up logic programming (e.g., Datalog) runs via repeated relational‐algebra kernels - selection, projection, join, and reorder - until no new facts emerge. While GPUs promise massive parallelism for these primitives, existing engines remain CPU-bound (8–16 threads) and struggle with deduplication and growing result sets.<br><br>
We introduce a WebGPU-based hash-join pipeline that:<br>
- Maps each RA primitive (hash‐join, GPU radix sort, deduplication, set difference, insertion into the full relation) to its own WGSL compute shader<br>
- Uses dynamic, growable GPU buffers and load-factor-tuned hash tables for memory management<br>
- Drives a delta-only fixed-point loop, processing only newly discovered tuples each iteration<br>
