This year&rsquo;s Art of HPC showcase at the <ahref="https://sc25.supercomputing.org/">International Conference for High Performance Computing SC25</a>, brought together an inspiring community of artists, designers, and technologists exploring the intersections of creativity, high-performance computing, AI, and immersive media. The Art Gallery became a vibrant hub of curiosity and inspiration, where the audience could explore new possibilities at the intersection of art and cutting-edge computation.<br><br>
UIC Design and EVL Professor Daria Tsoupikova participated on the panel &ldquo;From Silicon to Surrealism: The Fusion of Art, AI, and HPC,&rdquo; moderated by Tomasz Bednarz with Amy Karle, Ruth West, and Mark Hereld. The discussion explored how large-scale computation is opening new frontiers in creative expression, from generative imagery to immersive storytelling, and how artistic inquiry, in turn, is reshaping our understanding of the purpose and potential of computing itself.<br><br>
The EVL Hummingbird VR Performance project, featured prominently in the exhibition, was displayed on giant displays across the show floor, in the Art Gallery, and in the poster ballroom. It was awe-inspiring for Tsoupikova to share this work, born from deep collaboration between theater artists, designers, and computer scientists, which was truly inspiring.<br><br>
This was Tsoupikova&rsquo;s first SC, &ldquo;I am deeply grateful to the Art of HPC Committee Joseph Insley, Francesca Samsel, Mark Hereld, India Gordon and Silvina Caino-Lores for championing and elevating artistic innovation at SC25. Their vision made this year&rsquo;s program groundbreaking.&rdquo;<br>

<strong><a href="https://sc25.supercomputing.org/program/art-of-hpc/">The Art of HPC</a> Where Creativity Meets HPC:</strong><br>
Creativity has always been at the heart of innovation. It drives new perspectives, fuels artistic expression, and allows us to see beauty in unexpected places. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and resources, we can push the boundaries of both science and art.<br><br>
SC proudly presents Art of HPC, a showcase of the intersection between artistic creativity and high-performance computing. This comprehensive event featured a diverse array of exhibits, presentations, and activities throughout the conference.<br><br>
<strong>The Art of HPC Panel:</strong><br>
High-performance computing and AI are sparking a thrilling new era in creativity and the arts. This dynamic panel brought together visionary artists and cutting-edge technologists to reveal how they harness the power of large-scale computation to craft works that dazzle the senses, resonate culturally, and often surprise us in delightful ways. From mesmerizing generative imagery to immersive, interactive experiences, the panelists demonstrated how HPC unlocks artistic possibilities at scales and resolutions previously unimaginable.<br><br>
But the excitement doesn&rsquo;t stop there - this is a two-way street. Artistic practices aren&rsquo;t just benefiting from big tech; they&rsquo;re reshaping how we think about computing itself, transforming its purpose from mere efficiency and scientific rigor to a wellspring of inspiration and expressive power. The panel provided an accessible and fascinating peek into a future where silicon and creativity join forces, co-designing bold new forms of culture and unlocking realms of imagination we&rsquo;ve yet to explore.<br><br>
