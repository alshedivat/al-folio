Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) alumna Anushka Anand received the 10-year Test of Time Award at the IEEE VIS 2025 conference this month. A &ldquo;Test of Time&rdquo; award is a highly-prestigious accolade given by academic and professional organizations to recognize published papers that have had a significant and lasting impact on their field. These awards honor research that has remained influential and useful long after its initial publication, often after a minimum of 10 years. Anushka Anand accepted the award. Here is the accolade:<br><br>
<strong>2015 (10-Years InfoVis ToT Award):<br>
Voyager: Exploratory Analysis via Faceted Browsing of Visualization Recommendations</strong><br>

This work represents a major landmark in the development of visualization technology, transforming from human-led interactive visualization to a mixed-initiative approach, with which visualization plots are automatically generated as machine-led recommendations. In the paper, the authors presented not only the novel concept, but also the Voyager system for demonstrating the concept, including its architecture, algorithmic components, and visual design, together with a study for comparing it with another system. With the advancement of AI, the mixed-initiative approach is even more relevant today.
