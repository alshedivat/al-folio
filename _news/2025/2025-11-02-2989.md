Regretted Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) faculty Leland Wilkinson and EVL alumna Anushka Anand received the 20-Years InfoVis Test of Time Award at the IEEE VIS 2025 conference meeting this month.  A &ldquo;Test of Time&rdquo; award is a highly-prestigious accolade given by academic and professional organizations to recognize published papers that have had a significant and lasting impact on their field. These awards honor research that has remained influential and useful long after its initial publication, often after a minimum of 10 years. Anushka Anand accepted the award. Here is the accolade:<br><br>
Graph-theoretic scagnostics<br>

In this highly influential work, the authors established the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of the now well-known scagnostics techniques for visualizing high-dimensional multivariate data. While they duly acknowledged John and Paul Tukey for the original idea, they not only formalized the concept of scagnostics but also introduced a suite of graph-theoretic measures to enable feature-driven visualization. The impact of this work extends well beyond scatter plots, setting a gold standard for visualizing complex datasets through the analysis of visual features in their graphical representations.
