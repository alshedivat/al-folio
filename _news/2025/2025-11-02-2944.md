Join us in congratulating Nafiul Nipu and co-authors for a newly accepted paper in the <a href="https://visualanalyticshealthcare.github.io/homepage/2025/">VAHC: 16th Annual Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare</a> at IEEE VIS'25. The Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC) is the premier research event exploring the application of data visualization and visual analytics to biomedicine.  The Workshop is organized by General Chair Alessio Arleo, Eindhoven University of Technology, and Co-Chairs Renata Raidou, TU Vienna and Gabriela Morgenshtern, University of Zurich.<br><br>
N. Nipu, L. van Dijk, G. Canahuate, C.D. Fuller, G.E. Marai, &ldquo;Lessons from the Development and Deployment of an Interactive Oncological Risk Estimator&rdquo;, VAHC 2025 (16th workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare), in conjunction with IEEE VIS 2025, Vienna, Austria, pp. 1-7, November 2025.<br><br>
This is a &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; paper about our experience developing and deploying an interactive dashboard for predicting oncological risk in head and neck cancer. The tool is hosted at EVL as <a href="https://risk-calculator.evl.uic.edu/">https://risk-calculator.evl.uic.edu/</a>, it is publicly available, and it is currently used by a large clinician base across multiple continents, which is very impressive. From the data visualization perspective, this work is particularly interesting because we collected clinician feedback more than a year after the initial deployment.
