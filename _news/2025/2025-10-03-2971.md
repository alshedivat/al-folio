On Friday, October 3rd, EVL hosted the College of Engineering&rsquo;s Fall 2025 Advisory Board meeting in EVL&rsquo;s new visual data science space <a href="https://arcade.evl.uic.edu/web/"><strong>Arcade</strong></a>.  Arcade is located in the new Computer Design Research Learning Center (CDRLC) building and is an instrument designed for UIC science and engineering research and research training - a digital Project Room that enables domain scientists and computer scientists to collaborate on real-world problems by providing them with high-performance computing, high-resolution displays, and sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI), data analytic, data simulation, image processing, visualization, and virtual-reality software and services.<br><br>
Arcade offers on-site computing with adequate support, as well as collaboration software services.  It is a configurable computing environment that prioritizes real-time, interactive, collaborative, and data-intensive applications, while also supporting off-hours batch-mode processing. Users can execute code more quickly, apply more sophisticated analytics to large-scale problems, gain deeper insights, and open new avenues of research. The Arcade&rsquo;s collaboration software enables researchers to interact locally with colleagues using the display walls or engage in video-teleconferences while simultaneously sharing and interacting with their data on the large displays, which remote viewers can also access online.
