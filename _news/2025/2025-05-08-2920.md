<strong>Motivation:</strong><br>
- Dragonfly networks suffer from inter-job interference due to shared global links.<br>
- Existing routing algorithms fail to account for system-wide job patterns and link congestion.<br>
- Modern HPC systems offer flexible job placement, allowing users to specify workload locations for optimized performance.
