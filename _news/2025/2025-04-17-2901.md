Dan Sandin, inventor of the Sandin Analog Image Processor (IP) participated in a panel presentation on &ldquo;The Radical Art of the Sandin Image Processor,&rdquo; sponsored by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) at the Gene Siskel Film Center.  The presentation not only featured Sandin, but artists who used the Sandin IP to create old and new works of art.  The event was enhanced by the audience&rsquo;s capability to interact in person with a functioning IP!<br><br>
The Sandin Image Processor debuted in 1973 as a groundbreaking analog computer, enabling users to create astonishing video effects in real time. By encouraging other artists to &ldquo;copy-it-right,&rdquo; Sandin paved the way for producing dozens of image processors across the United States, making the machine one of the most influential tools for experimental video and performance art.  More than 50 years later, the IP continues to inspire, connecting artists, hardware developers, and computer programmers across generations. To mark this anniversary, &ldquo;The Radical Art of the Sandin Image Processor,&rdquo; brings together a range of works created with the Sandin Image Processor over the years, including two new commissions by artists Lee Blalock and Jon Satrom.  James Connolly engaged the audience with a live public performance of one of the SAIC&rsquo;s own IPs.<br><br>
The event was presented in partnership with <a Href="https://www.vdb.org/">Video Data Bank</a> and <a Href="https://mediaburn.org/https://mediaburn.org/">Media Burn Archive</a>.  Special thanks SAIC.<br><br>
