Congratulations to Stefan Cobeli and Kazi Omar on the publication of the their paper entitled &ldquo;A Neural Field-Based Approach for View Computation & Data Exploration in 3D Urban Environments&rdquo;, Stefan Cobeli, Kazi Omar, Rodrigo Valença, Nivan Ferreira, Fabio Miranda, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (To appear)<br><br>
This paper presents a neural, view-based method that encodes 3D urban environments as an implicit vector field, supporting fast direct and inverse viewpoint queries for visibility, solar exposure, and building-impact analyses.<br><br>
Code, results are available at <a href="https://urbantk.org/neural-3d/">https://urbantk.org/neural-3d/</a><br><br>
This is Cobeli&rsqup;s first TVCG paper and Omar&rsquo;s second (and Omar&rsquo; third IEEE Transaction publication overall). And great teamwork throughout with Cobeli masterfully leading the writing, modeling, and experiments, while Omar handled the interface and component integration.
EVL Graduate Students Stefan Cobeli & Kazi Omar
