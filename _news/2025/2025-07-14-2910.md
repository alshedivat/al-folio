We present the development, architecture, and features of a new multi-device mHealth software platform to support near real-time remote monitoring of metabolic health and timely intervention in the treatment and survivorship of cancer patients. Our platform, mEnergy, leverages a human-centered design process, and integrates in a unified, web-based framework consumer-grade hardware - Fitbit wearable sensor devices, smartphones, and Withings smart scales. mEnergy can
aid oncologists in identifying early indicators of muscle-wasting (sarcopenia) due to sleep disturbance, insufficient weight recovery, or reduced/limited activity. The platform aims for a smooth transition into clinical practice and increased adherence to evidence-based recommendations, in particular in underserved geographical areas. This toxicity-surveillance approach based on mHealth technologies can improve treatment outcomes, quality of life, and survivorship.
