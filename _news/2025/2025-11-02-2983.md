EVL, Computer Science Professor and Director, UIC Institute for Health Data Science Research, Liz Marai delivered the Keynote at the <a href="https://visualanalyticshealthcare.github.io/homepage/2025/program.html">Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC) 2025</a> meeting in early November in Vienna, Austria.  VAHC is associated with <a href="https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/welcome">IEEE VIS 2025</a> held November 2 - 7, 2025.<br><br>
<strong>Title:</strong> &ldquo;The Blackbox Patient and the Power-of-Many&rdquo;<br><br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
Precision medicine aims to tailor treatment for individual patients based on big data collected from cohorts of similar patients. This power-of-many can also be used to predict treatment outcomes and treatment-related side effects for individual patients. Visual computing and visual analytics play a crucial role in addressing this problem, from calculating spatial similarity to facilitating risk communication. This talk reflects on work in this area, emerging lessons, and future research directions.
