Approximately forty Chicago Public School teachers will participate in the workshop &ldquo;Teaching Environmental & Climate Justice Across Boundaries&rdquo; held in EVL&rsquo;s Continuum environment, June 26, 2025, noon - 3:00 pm.  The goal of this event is to gather CPS teacher perspectives on how to revitalize environmental science within CPS, which is currently undergoing restructuring.  This will also be an opportunity to brainstorm new ideas for classroom projects that bridge the gap between classroom and community, as well as between disciplines -- for example, chemistry and computer science, or social studies and biology.<br><br>
The workshop is organized by Daniel Morales-Doyle and Kaleb Germinaro (UIC College of Education), Alejandra Frausto Aceves (Northwestern), Michelle Rabkin (Director of Science at CPS), and Fabio Miranda (EVL).
