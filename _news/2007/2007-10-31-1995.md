<em>Interrogation</em> is a network of projects that includes seizure-edited video and live re-enactment of that video. The work is shown as video, live theater reproducing that video and video of live theater reproducing the initial video. <em>Interrogation</em> is currently being folded into Dog Days, a larger-scale theatrical production.
