<em>Apple :: Science :: Profiles</em><br>
The Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago has been the source of many widely used visualization tools, including the well-known CAVE environment.<br><br>

Corewall, a software / hardware solution developed under an NSF grant, enables geoscientists to store and view images of scanned cores at high resolutions.<br><br>

Co-principal EVL investigators Andy Johnson and Luc Renambot, working with graduate students James Lee and Julian Yu-Chung Chen, combined Mac workstations and Apple Cinema displays with Corewall&rsquo;s Corelyzer core analysis software to provide tiled, high-resolution viewing platforms.<br><br>

&ldquo;The introduction of the 30-inch Apple Cinema Displays made creating tiled displays with fewer screens much easier,&rdquo; says Jason Leigh, Director of EVL. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to have so much aggregate resolution on one big display. The standard Corewall configuration is now two 30-inch Apple Cinema Displays with 8 megapixels of resolution.&rdquo;<br><br>

Other software in the Corewall suite, developed at other institutions under the same NSF grant, provide a database for the storage of annotation data, a browser for locating cores of interest at websites worldwide, and a system for the geographic correlation of cores drilled in proximity to each other.<br><br>

The CoreWall project development team includes researchers from the Lacustrine Core Repository at the University of Minnesota, the Borehole Research Group at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, and INSTAAR at the University of Colorado.
