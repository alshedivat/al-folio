Individuals standing in the CAVE2&trade; System interactively fly through Earth&rsquo;s galaxy to observe constellations from different viewpoints. Data is from the European Space Agency&rsquo;s Tycho-2 catalog, which contains the positions and magnitudes of more than 2.5 million of the brightest stars collected by the star mapper of the Hipparcos satellite. EVL graduate Robert Kooima created this application; his Electro software is being used to display it in the CAVE2.
