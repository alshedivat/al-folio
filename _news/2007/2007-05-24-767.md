EVL Director, Jason Leigh presents EVL&rsquo;s latest research in advanced visualization techniques and technologies to the Center for Computation &amp; Technology at Louisiana State University, May 24, 2007, 2:00 - 3:00pm - Life Sciences Building Annex A101 Auditorium.<br><br>

<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
In 1992 EVL invented the CAVE, a room-sized immersive virtual reality environment. Since then EVL has pursued a wide range of research topics.<br><br>

The presentation will provide an overview of EVL&rsquo;s recent research in visualization, high speed networking, and computer supported cooperative work that has been conducted as part of the OptIPuter project.<br><br>

The OptIPuter, so named for its use of Optical networking, Internet Protocol, computer storage, processing and visualization technologies, is an envisioned infrastructure that will tightly couple computational resources over parallel optical networks using the IP communication mechanism.<br><br>

The OptIPuter exploits a new world in which the central architectural element is optical networking, not computers - creating &ldquo;supernetworks&rdquo;.<br><br>

This paradigm shift requires large-scale applications-driven, system experiments and a broad multidisciplinary team to understand and develop innovative solutions for a &ldquo;LambdaGrid&rdquo; world. The goal of this new architecture is to enable scientists who are generating terabytes and petabytes of data to interactively visualize, analyze, and correlate their data from multiple storage sites connected to optical networks.
