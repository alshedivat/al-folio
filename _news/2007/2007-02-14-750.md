The National Science Foundation (NSF) awards a three-year collaborative project titled &ldquo;Towards Life-like Computer Interfaces that Learn&rdquo;, that combines computer animation, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and natural language processing to develop a methodology for creating intelligent digital humans that can process human voice and gesture input and respond appropriately using similarly natural voice and gestures. The technology can be used in a variety of applications such as creating 3D archival recordings of important historical figures, virtual reality learning environments, and intelligent characters for next-generation video games.<br><br>

UIC&rsquo;s research team will develop the graphics component of the project, and build a new state-of-the-art motion-capture studio to support project requirements. This technology will also be used as part of the UIC Computer Science Department&rsquo;s Computer Animation, Virtual Reality, and Video Game Programming curriculum. Project members at CFU will work on the database and natural language processing components.
