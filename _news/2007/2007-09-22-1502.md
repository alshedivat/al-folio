The Sensimmer platform represents our ongoing research on simultaneous haptics and graphics rendering of 3D models. For simulation of medical and surgical procedures using Sensimmer, 3D models must be obtained from medical imaging data, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT). Image segmentation techniques are used to determine the anatomies of interest from the images. 3D models are obtained from segmentation and their triangle reduction is required for graphics and haptics rendering. This paper focuses on creating an integrated interface between Sensimmer and medical imaging devices, using available software. Existing tools are evaluated, as well as aspects that require further development are identified. Solutions to overcome limitations and increase the degree of automation of the process are examined.
