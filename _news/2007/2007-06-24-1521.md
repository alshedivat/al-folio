Nanoscience and engineering are the wave of the future, and nanoscience education is key to developing the next generation of innovative developers. However many K-12 students have difficulty relating to science that they cannot directly observe.<br><br>

Virtual reality based simulations are helpful for exploring these sorts of phenomena, however they must be firmly grounded back to a frame of reference with which students are familiar.<br><br>

This paper presents a progression of learning which uses pixels on a computer screen as a unifying theme to lead students from physical models to microscopic exploration and finally to nanoscale exploration in a virtual world.
