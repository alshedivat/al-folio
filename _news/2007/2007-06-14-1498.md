Low-cost computing, displays and networking is making it possible to create collaboration environments that are truly able to bridge distance.<br><br>

This paper describes EVL&rsquo;s work since 1992 that has pursued the goal of creating collaboration environments that have been able to seamless merge high-resolution 2D information with 3D information incorporating a variety of viewing and interaction modalities.
