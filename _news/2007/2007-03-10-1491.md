Although Image-Plane techniques have been associated with user fatigue and selection ambiguity problems, they can act as a bridging strategy between 2D desktop and 3D immersive environments. We introduce a framework that facilitates such transitions by using Image-Plane techniques with a virtual cursor visible only in the dominant eye on 2D interfaces below the hand of the user.<br><br>

We have developed a proof of concept virtual world building application for the Ygdrasil authoring platform that demonstrates our framework. We propose that this framework facilitates the authoring and utilization of 3D user interfaces in general by leveraging existing computer skills, reinforcing the interface in the 2D environment and unifying the development effort for both platforms.
