Hiring someone based solely on a phone interview or a videoconference meeting is something Hugh Morris said he has never done and never would.<br><br>

Yet, Morris, executive director of a London-based business processing service firm, said that he has hired people he has never met in person but has interviewed using high-end video technology called telepresence.<br><br>

&ldquo;They really do appear to be across the table, looking life-sized,&rdquo; said Morris. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as meeting in person.&rdquo;<br><br>

By using large flat-screen displays, cameras placed behind the displays and high-quality lighting and sound, several firms, including high-tech stalwarts Cisco Systems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., are betting they can create video-based meetings in which it is possible to interact with people, no matter how far away, as if they were in the same room.<br><br>

It&rsquo;s an old quest. Since AT&amp;T rolled out its first PicturePhone four decades ago, videoconferencing has fascinated engineers and underwhelmed customers. This time, the engineers believe they have it right, producing full-size, high-definition images of people who look you in the eye as they speak and whose facial expressions and body language can easily be read.<br><br>

Developed at universities such as the University of Illinois at Chicago a decade ago, telepresence is starting to reach its commercial potential. The industry has about 650 high-tech meeting rooms in place worldwide, although that number likely will rise to more than 10,000 within a few years, said Howard Lichtman, who operates the Human Productivity Lab in Ashburn, Va., a telepresence consultancy.
