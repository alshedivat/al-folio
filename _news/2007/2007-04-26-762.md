The Bridge Art Fair focuses on emerging and new contemporary work in all media. This includes but is not limited to painting, prints, photography, sculpture, installation, drawing, film, video, new media and conceptual art. The goal of the Bridge Art Fair, an international exposition of new art, is to broaden the exposure of emerging and contemporary art and artists by providing a cost-effective showcase for the best in new art from both established and emerging galleries, ateliers, storefronts, artist collectives and artist-run spaces.<br><br>

The Gosia Koscielak Gallery represents contemporary American and International artists in all media. Art works shown reflect the complexity and diversity of current aesthetic practices, spanning cultures and disciplines, and creating a bridge between new media and established art forms. The gallery is a Global - Local (GLOCAL) Art Platform providing an opportunity for Chicagoans to experience the constantly changing international art scene. Gosia Koscielak Gallery promotes a strong curatorial program which represents a broad context of art based on very personal, individual approaches to the exhibition process.
