UIC News Release<br>
March 12, 2007<br>
CONTACT: Paul Francuch, (312) 996-3457, francuch @ uic.edu<br><br>

Imagine having a discussion with Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein on the nature of the universe, where their 3-D, life-sized representations looked you in the eye, examined your body language, considered voice nuances and phraseology of your questions, then answered you in a way that is so real you would swear the images were alive.<br><br>

This was an opening scene from an episode of the TV show &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; almost a decade and a half ago. A new research project between the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Central Florida in Orlando may soon make such imaginary conversations a reality.<br><br>

Technology from computer games, animation and artificial intelligence provide the elements to make this happen. The National Science Foundation has awarded a half-million dollar, three-year grant to UIC and UCF researchers to bring those elements together and create the methodology for making such virtual figures commonplace.<br><br>

UIC will focus on the computer graphics and interaction while UCF will concentrate on artificial intelligence and natural language processing software.<br><br>

&ldquo;The goal is to combine artificial intelligence with the latest advanced graphics and video game-type technology to enable us to create historical archives of people beyond what can be achieved using traditional technologies such as text, audio and video footage,&rdquo; said Jason Leigh, associate professor of computer science and director of UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory. Leigh is UIC&rsquo;s lead principal investigator. <br><br>

EVL will build a state-of-the-art motion-capture studio to digitalize the image and movement of real people who will go on to live a virtual eternity in virtual reality. Knowledge will be archived into databases. Voices will be analyzed to create synthesized but natural-sounding &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; voices. Mannerisms will be studied and used in creating the 3-D virtual forms, known technically as avatars.
