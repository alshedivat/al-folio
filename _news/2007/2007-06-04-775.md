<strong>UIC Working on Making Virtual Chats a Reality</strong><br>
By Jon Van<br><br>

June 4, 2007<br><br>

In five or six years, you probably will be able to chat face-to-face with your favorite actor, musician or politician whenever you feel like it.<br><br>

The technology for such virtual, three-dimensional visits mostly exists or is being developed by video game companies. Now, researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago are at work to apply this to virtual conversations.<br><br>

Working with colleagues at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, the computer scientists have a three-year, half-million dollar grant from the National Science Foundation to do the job.<br><br>

Graphics technology is already good enough to create realistic-looking human avatars in 3-D, said Jason Leigh, director of UIC&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory. Speech recognition is better than 90 percent accurate, and imaging-processing speeds by computers are close to real time.
