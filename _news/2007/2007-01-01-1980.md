RTK is an open source API that enables applications to co-schedule CPU cores, GPUs, Memory and Network resources within multi- and many- core computer systems. We define a &ldquo;Rail&rdquo; as the co-scheduling of two or more of these resources. Using RTK, applications will be able to create one or more rails over which their data-intensive computation and data retrieval can be accelerated without interference from other rails or applications - hence dramatically increasing performance. RTK can be used to improve the performance of high performance computing applications, high-speed data delivery applications, as well as high-resolution graphics and video streaming.
