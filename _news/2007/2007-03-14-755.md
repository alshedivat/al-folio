<em>R. Colin Johnson, EE Times, PORTLAND, Ore.</em> - The National Science Foundation (NSF) is funding development of electronic visualization technology, providing $500,000 in seed money to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and the University of Central Florida in Orlando.<br><br>

&ldquo;Our budget is about one-fiftieth of a typical video game developer&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said researcher Jason Leigh, a UIC professor and director of its Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL). Still, &ldquo;we think we can put together a working prototype by 2009.&rdquo;<br><br>

The three-year effort will begin with graduate students spending several months shadowing an undisclosed NSF official to record his mannerisms, gait and lifestyle in a series of video and audio recordings. Back at the lab in Chicago, students will craft avatars that digitize all the visual aspects of the mystery NSF director.
