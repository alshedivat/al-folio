Presentation of the motivations, inspirations, design and architecture of an ecology learning environment for middle school science classrooms.<br><br>

The application, WallCology, places a virtual ecosystem within the walls of a classroom, drawing from ubiquitous computing concepts.<br><br>

The system is designed to give learners easy access to affordances for the study of ecological phenomena as ecologists would in the field.<br><br>

Using a set of computers as portals into the virtual ecosystem, students study creatures with different morphologies and behaviors moving about on pipes and walls.<br><br>

These portals, called WallScopes, are linked together using a remote server which allows the creatures to move within the larger virtual space based on their own environmental preferences.<br><br>

A two month pilot study of WallCology in an urban middle school classroom comprised of species differentiation and population estimation units demonstrated the feasibility of this approach.
