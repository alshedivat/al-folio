Drew Browning and Annette Barbier exhibit their work &ldquo;Search Terms&rdquo; at Polvo Chicago in the &ldquo;Echelon: who is watching you?&rdquo; exhibition.  Curated by Miguel Cortez, &ldquo;Echelon&rdquo; explores the history of surveillance and how this affects us at this present time.<br><br>

<a href="http://www.unreal-estates.com/">&ldquo;Search Terms&rdquo;</a> is a substantial re-making of Browning&rsquo;s / Barbier&rsquo;s work entitled &ldquo;Rise / Run&ldquo;. It is an interactive installation that critiques ubiquitous surveillance, tracking visitors&rsquo; movements as they explore &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; and &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; book listings and surreptitious views of gallery visitors.<br><br>

Echelon Opening: Friday, August 3 from 6pm-10pm<br>
Exhibiton: August 3 - September 1, 2007
