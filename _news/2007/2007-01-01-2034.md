Participants interactively fly around a 3D representation of Mars in the CAVE2&trade; System. The 3D model was originally created by EVL graduate Robert Kooima using planetary data from NASA&rsquo;s Mars Global Surveyor and Viking missions and star data from the European Space Agency&rsquo;s Hipparcos mission. Kooima&rsquo;s Electro software is used to display the 3D model in the CAVE2.
