The University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine will introduce biomedical tele-immersion into the curriculum of surgical residents beginning in July. The residents will participate in a unique research project to measure whether virtual reality technology, high-performance computing and high-speed networking cam improve medical education. With a new $1.04 million grant from the National Institutes of Health National Library of Medicine, UIC researchers are developing and refining virtual models of the liver, <a href="http://www.ahs.uic.edu/ahs/php/section.php?id=309">pelvic floor</a> and <a href="http://www.ahs.uic.edu/ahs/php/section.php?id=300">temporal bone</a>, and studying the models&rsquo; impact on medical education and training.<br><br>

The project is a collaboration among researchers in the <a href="http://www.ahs.uic.edu/ahs/php/index.php?sitename=vrml">Virtual Reality in Medicine Laboratory</a> in UIC&rsquo;s College of Health and Human Development Sciences, the UIC College of Engineering&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory, the UIC College of Medicine&rsquo;s departments of surgery, head and neck surgery and medical education, as well as physicians in the colon and rectal surgery department at neighboring Cook County Hospital.
