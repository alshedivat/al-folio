Watching Gollum, a computer-generated character in &ldquo;The Two Towers,&rdquo; the second movie in the &ldquo;Lord of the Rings&rdquo; trilogy, Gar-Field High School graduate Chris White knew he wanted to be a part of the third film.<br><br>

&ldquo;The first film was impressive,&rdquo; White said, &ldquo;but after seeing the second one, this is a project you want to work on.&rdquo;<br><br>

The 31-year-old, who grew up in Woodbridge, was a sequence supervisor for special effects in &ldquo;The Return of the King,&rdquo; digitally creating characters and the destruction of the Black Gates of Mordor.<br><br>

His art with the visual effects team helped &ldquo;The Return of the King&rdquo; win 27 Oscars from 11 nominations.<br><br>

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still buzzing down here,&rdquo; White said via phone from New Zealand. &ldquo;We had a big party here [in Wellington] which they were showing up there [in the United States].&rdquo;<br><br>

White was doing graduate work at the University of Illinois at Chicago in electronic visualization when he saw &ldquo;The Two Towers.&rdquo; He e-mailed his resume to Joe Letteri, &ldquo;The Return of the King&rdquo; visual effects supervisor, with whom he worked previously at George Lucas&rsquo; visual effects company, Industrial Light &amp; Magic. In June 2003 he moved to an ocean-front apartment in New Zealand and worked on the film in its final six to seven months.
