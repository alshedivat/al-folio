Experience an exhibit unlike any other gallery show for one night only! Fourteen artists join curator and director Andrew Hicks for &ldquo;Juxtaposition Arena - a dismantling of gallery norms. Experience visual art on the walls, screens, and in space as projected images overlap, blur, and create a unified meta-piece. Sound artists and a live band will perform in addition.<br><br>

This collection of artists and performers represent a rich sampling of Chicago talent. Students, teachers, curators, recent graduates, and programmers are coming together and sublimating their egos in order to try something new.<br><br>

EVL Alumni Tina Shah will exhibit her latest artwork, Cue. Cue is a systems-based piece that tracks visitors&rsquo; color data and associates these colors with recurring memories from her native country, India, in video format.
