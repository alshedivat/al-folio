The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded a $2.6 million grant to lead institution Northern Illinois University and sub-recipient the University of Illinois Chicago for classroom training and research opportunities in computational high energy physics.<br><br>
EVL faculty and Computer Science professor Mike Papka, and EVL director of research, professor Andy Johnson will lead the computational and high-performance computing aspect of this project.  They will collaborate with UIC Physics professor Richard Cavanaugh to mentor students in computational high-energy physics education.<br><br>
The 5-year award will provide two dozen master&rsquo;s-level students in physics and computer science stipends, tuition reimbursement, and distinctive research experiences in the HEP domain.<br><br>
Dr. Cavanaugh specializes in Particle Physics and holds a joint appointment with Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FermiLab).  As the Deputy Associate Laboratory Director, Computing, Environment, and Life Sciences at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Dr. Papka has unprecedented experience in high-performance computing.  They will provide students a unique opportunity to collaborate with scientists at the DOE&rsquo;s ANL and FermiLab.<br><br>
