APLU&rsquo;s Council on Academic Affairs (CAA) provosts, chief academic officers, and senior vice presidents for academic affairs of APLU member institutions and systems visited EVL for presentations and CAVE2 virtual reality experiences during their 2022 Summer Meeting, July 18th.  The annual meeting was hosted by the University of Illinois at Chicago July 17 - 19.  This event provides a unique opportunity for senior leaders to meet in a private setting to network and discuss important topics of current interest. This year, the meeting focused on the pandemic&rsquo;s impact on faculty and student performance and engagement as well as their mental health issues, preparing students for the current and future workforce needs, and emerging uses of AI in higher education.<br><br>
