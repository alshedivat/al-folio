Following the premiere of &ldquo;Hummingbird&rdquo; as part of the Chicago&rsquo;s Tony Award-winning Goodman Theatre New Stages Festival in December 2021, the virtual reality theatrical experience was exhibited at the SIGGRAPH 2022 Conference Immersive Pavilion held in Vancouver, CA, August 8-11th.  Team members enhanced the existing experience to allow for a stand-alone version running consecutively for 4 days to sell-out audiences/participants - augmenting interactivity, animations, videography as well as upgrades to the underlying software and VR systems.  By all accounts the exhibition was extremely well received and a success.<br><br>
&ldquo;Hummingbird: Multi-User Virtual Reality Theater for Collaborative Tele-Immersive Exploration&rdquo; is a modern, innovative performance, merging live theater and interactive virtual reality by bringing a group of active participants into a shared space for a live performance.  This project bridges art, science and live theater through a collaborative research effort between computer science and design faculty and students at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) and Chicago theater directors, actors, videographers and producers.  &ldquo;Hummingbird&rdquo; is developed by Daria Tsoupikova (Professor, School of Design); Andrew Johnson (Professor, EVL, Computer Science); Jo Cattell (Goodman Theatre); Lance Long (Senior Research Programmer, EVL, Computer Science); Arthur Nishimoto (PhD Candidate, EVL, Computer Science); Sai Jyothula Priya (PhD Candidate, EVL, Computer Science).
Participants engaged in the &ldquo;Hummingbird&rdquo; virtual reality performance at S2022.
