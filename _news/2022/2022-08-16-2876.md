## High Performance Computing Research



![image](/images/edgecomputing.jpg-srcw.jpg){:style="max-width: 100%"}

High-Performance Computing research and development supports the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) supercomputer&rsquo;s use and operations, including:<br>
- Visualization and analysis of abstract datasets based on ALCF operational logs, visualization of workflow execution and data transfers, dashboard development for monitoring of systems, and integration of edge devices into HPC workflow.
- Development of code and algorithms that demonstrate the use of Intel oneAPI for the ALCF supercomputer Aurora.
- Evaluation of Unity and Unreal gaming engine visualizations for virtual reality environments from data generated using Argonne supercomputers.
- Development of HPC material focused on undergraduate education.
- Production of documentation and sample code as needed.
- Exploration of alternative administration environments to better support the deployment of science portals (Kubernetes).
