Call for Papers<br>
---------------<br>
There is widespread lack of accessibility in built environments, from roads and housing to public buildings and spaces. Such inaccessible urban infrastructure not only contributes to and further reinforces systemic exclusion of people with disabilities but also impacts public health, physical activity, and quality of life for all. To improve the design of our cities and to enable new accessibility-infused analytic tools and interactive maps, we need new data collection techniques, data standards, policies, and planning tools focused on the quality and accessibility of pathways, transit ecosystems, and buildings.<br><br>
The goal of our &ldquo;The Future of Urban Accessibility&rdquo; workshop is to bring together a community of scholars and practitioners across disciplines, disability identities, cultures, and geographies to discuss the state of urban accessibility and the role of interactive technologies therein. We invite short papers, including experience reports, position papers, vision pieces,  demonstrations, pictorials, or research summaries up to 2,000 words on this topic (references excluded). Papers should not be anonymized and, in addition to their primary content, should include a bio of each author and rationale for attending the workshop. Papers will be reviewed and selected by the co-organizers to balance topics, geographies, and communities of focus. Accepted authors will be required to register and virtually attend the workshop via Zoom on Mon, Oct 17th.<br><br>
Please submit your papers/artifacts by Thu, Sep 1 at 11:59PM AoE. We are using Microsoft&rsquo;s Conference Management Toolkit to handle submissions <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/UrbanAccess2022/Submission/Index">(https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/UrbanAccess2022/Submission/Index)</a><br><br>
Our overarching goal is to identify open challenges, share current work across disciplines, and spur new collaborations. As a secondary goal, we aim to synthesize and publish our discussions together in a jointly authored report perhaps to the SIGACCESS Newsletter or beyond.<br><br>
Please join us. We welcome your contributions! Email questions to: <a href="mailto:urbanaccess2022@cs.uw.edu">urbanaccess2022@cs.uw.edu</a>.<br><br>
