July 19th - 22nd, EVL hosted the SAGE3 research and development team to discuss the past year&rsquo;s major activities, significant results, key outcomes, other achievements, and future developments.  Meeting topics include current SAGE3 usage patterns, user interface assessment and refinement, documentation improvements, future development requirements, as well as the dissemination of research results to the SAGE user community.<br><br>
&ldquo;SAGE3: Smart Amplified Group Environment for Harnessing the Data Revolution&rdquo; has been funded by the NSF CSI program to continue and advance its efforts on the SAGE collaboration and visualization framework. SAGE3 - Smart Amplified Group Environment - is the next-generation, &ldquo;human-in-the-loop&rdquo; collaboration platform with artificial intelligence (AI) enabled services that serve as a user’s &ldquo;co-pilot&rdquo; to autonomously manage and link disparate datasets and orchestrate services. Its predecessors, SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment) in 2004 and second-generation SAGE2 (Scalable Amplified Group Environment) in 2013, are today&rsquo;s de facto operating systems to manage Big Data on tiled display walls, enabling users to collaborate locally and remotely and access, display, share and manipulate documents and visualizations.<br><br>
SAGE3 is being developed by renowned cyberinfrastructure experts from the Laboratory for Advanced Visualization and Applications (LAVA) and the Hawaii Data Science Institute (HI-DSI) at University of Hawaiʻi at Manoa (UHM), the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), and the Sanghani Center for AI and Data Analytics (Sanghani) at Virginia Tech (VT).
