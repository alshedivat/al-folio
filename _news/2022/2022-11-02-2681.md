AI competency will be an essential workforce skill. A group of computer scientists and learning science experts are considering what a foundational introduction to AI might look like for middle school and high school students.  EVL affiliated faculty, Michael E. Papka, professor of computer science at UIC and deputy associate laboratory director and supercomputing facility director at the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory, along with a like-minded group of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) educators, and computer scientists are researching the gap in future workforce skills in addressing AI problems. They began to brainstorm about a new tool, or perhaps a teaching module, that would introduce AI concepts to the young researchers of tomorrow.<br><br>
&ldquo;AI research is making major strides,&rdquo; said Papka.  &ldquo;We are seeing progress in many areas of AI, made not only by new techniques, but especially by new hardware for running computationally intensive AI models.&rdquo;<br><br>
