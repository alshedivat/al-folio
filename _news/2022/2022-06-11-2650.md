The exhibition will showcase works from the Chicago Design Archive taking viewers on a journey that begins in the 1920s with the era&rsquo;s painterly and illustrative techniques, evolves through the decades, and ends in the 2010s with digital rendering using AI and machine learning (ML)-technologies becoming increasingly prevalent in the contemporary landscape.<br><br>
