On January 25, 2022, EVL faculty member assistant professor Fabio Miranda was interviewed by Univision TV to discuss environmental contamination and the implication to Chicagoland Latino communities.  According to an investigation and recent study by UIC and Miranda &ldquo;the southwest of the city has a large presence of pollutants disproportionately affecting Latino communities.&rdquo; The study explores issues of local government perpetuating environmental racism. Miranda&rsquo;s research focuses on how visual data analytics can help address different problems cities face by integrating data on different resolutions and from different sources.
