Researchers at UIC from the Departments of Computer Science and the Department of Earth and Environmental  Sciences are studying how to design technology-enabled group learning experiences for Earth Science classrooms. The purpose of the GeoDataOnSphere project is to investigate how future teachers collaboratively explore and make meaning from large-scale geoscience data visualizations. Our team hopes to use the lessons learned from this research to design engaging collaborative learning software applications for Earth Science classrooms.<br><br>
This research is sponsored by <a href="https://isgc.aerospace.illinois.edu/ ">the Illinois Space Grant Consortium</a> via a subaward to UIC from UIUC.  Nikita Soni, Ph.D., a Computer Science Assistant Professor is the lead principal investigator on the project working with co-PI Stefany Sit Ph.D., a Clinical Associate Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. Feel free to contact Nikita Soni, Ph.D. at nnsoni@uic.edu for any queries.
