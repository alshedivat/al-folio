The <a href="http://www.sota.vt.edu">Virginia Tech School of the Arts</a>, the Department of Art &amp; Art History, and XYZ Gallery introduces Tom Coffin&rsquo;s, Field, a special installation of 24&rdquo; x 36&rdquo; printed images that will hang through April 14th. These images are reconstructed and abstracted photos of a field outside the residence of artist Jacqueline Matisse-Monnier, in France. Field is a visualization of the play inside opposite geometries of an image. The composition creates a yantric image. &ldquo;In Field, the &lsquo;play of opposites&rsquo; are at work. As the viewer steps into the images the levels become more involved and (the viewers) move toward a personal interpretation.&rdquo; Coffin states that he intends &ldquo;to evoke a moment of contemplation, investigation, and peace&rdquo; through his translucent installation pieces.<br><br>

Tom Coffin is the technical coordinator and co-creator of a groundbreaking virtual reality artwork, <a href="http://www.raykass.com/html/Matisse/html/">Art Flying In &amp; Out of Space</a>, a collaboration with Jacqueline Matisse-Monnier. &ldquo;Kites Flying In and Out of Space&rdquo; is a collaborative art piece initiated by the Mountain lake Workshop of the Virginia Tech Foundation. Coffin is currently employed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and is the Alliance Liaison for Virtual Environments, and the Technical Coordinator for the Alliance Center for Collaboration Education Science and Software in Arlington, Virginia.<br><br>

The exhibition is on display at XYZ Gallery, 223 North Main Street, Blacksburg, Virginia. A reception honoring the artist will take place Sunday, April 14, from 4:00pm to 6:00pm.
