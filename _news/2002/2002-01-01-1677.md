The <a href='http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/anr/maintenance/qosimoto.html'>QoS Internet Monitoring Tool</a>, or QoSIMoto, is a CAVE-based Netlogger visualization tool for monitoring and visualizing network flows in applications that use network Quality of Service.<br><br>

It currently supports offline Netlogger format logfile visualization, and it can do realtime streaming but streaming capabilities are being tested. Each flow of data is drawn across one axis of the graph. Parameter values can be mapped to height, width, and color over the timeline.
