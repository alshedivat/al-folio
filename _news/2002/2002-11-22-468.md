Beyond Prototypes presents new virtual reality artworks from the &ldquo;Immersive Environments&rdquo; graduate seminar at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.<br><br>

Gallery visitors are invited to explore virtual worlds ranging from the poetic to the bizarre, using cutting-edge technology including body tracking and stereoscopic video projection. Projects include architectural and sculptural visualizations, interactive narratives and experiments in hypertextual synaesthesia.<br><br>

Immersive Environments is a research seminar drawing students from a wide variety of disciplines, including video, sound, sculpture, architecture, writing, and computer programming. Students are introduced to advanced Virtual Reality development environments and asked to critique concepts ranging from animation and special effects to video games and cyber-porn. We explore the evolution of immersive technologies and discuss their primary benefits and detractions. Students develop their own digital aesthetics through exploring previous examples of work, contemporary theory and experimental research. Artists include Dima Al Srouri, Luke Bartels, Diane Figueredo, Paula Gilovich, Flora McGarrell, HyunJoo Oh, and Noah Sh. Seminar Instructors are Ben Chang and Todd Margolis.<br><br>

The exhibit opens Friday, November 22, and continues through Sunday, November 24 , at the 1926 Exhibition Studies Space, 1926 N. Halsted. The opening reception is Friday, November 22, from 5 to 8 p.m. Exhibition hours are Wednesday through Friday from 3 to 7 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 6 p.m.<br><br>

Throughout the academic year, The School of the Art Institute 1926 Exhibition Studies Space offers events and exhibitions that are free and open to the public.
