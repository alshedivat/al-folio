This paper describes the experiments of remote rendering over an intercontinental optical network during the iGrid2002 conference in Amsterdam from September 23-26.<br><br>

A rendering cluster in Chicago was used to generate images which were displayed in real-time on a four-tile visualization setup in Amsterdam. On average, one gigabit per second (1Gbps) was consumed to enable remote visualization, at interactive frame rate, with a 1600x1200 pixel configuration.<br><br>

Key words: remote visualization, parallel rendering, optical network, reliable UDP, interactive application.
