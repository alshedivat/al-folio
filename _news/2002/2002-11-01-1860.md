The objective of this project was to create visual effects for the independent film <em>Wrecker</em>.<br><br>

<em>Wrecker</em>, directed by Nadav Kurtz, explores how sound can influence our perception. In this sequence of the film we follow the sound from the source, through the ear, to fine hairs of the cilia.<br><br>

Computer generated imagery was developed to create the effect.
