JuxtaView is a tool designed specifically for scalable tiled displays to visualize extremely high-resolution images. Scientists are finding an increasing need to display visualizations on extremely high-resolution displays, such as EVL&rsquo;s 6000x3000-pixel LCD tiled display, called the PerspecTile, driven by a cluster of PCs. JuxtaView employs the MPI communication library to distribute Open GL commands for synchronization of display on all tiles.<br><br>

JuxtaView manages very large image datasets by using a software based network level cache system called LambdaRAM, a remote data access tool built over the <a href='http://www.evl.uic.edu/research/res_project.php3?indi=216'>QUANTA</a> networking API. <a href='http://www.evl.uic.edu/research/res_project.php3?indi=246'>LambdaRAM</a> enables an application to efficiently utilize a collective compute cluster memory to store extraordinarily large data and minimize latency effects by pre-fetching parts of the data before its is likely to be needed. The ultimate goal of JuxtaView is to enable a user to interactively roam through potentially terabytes of distributed, spatially referenced image data such as those from electron microscopes, satellites and aerial photographs.<br><br>

EVL has been developing this technology to support two domain research areas: Geosciences, in partnership with the <a href='http://sio.ucsd.edu'>Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a>, and Bioscience with the <a href='http://www.nbirn.net'>Biomedical Informatics Network Research (BIRN)</a> effort headed by the <a href='http://ncmir.ucsd.edu'>National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research</a> at the University of California, San Diego.<br><br>

Pictured here is EVL&rsquo;s Perspectile showing a stereo image of the Grand Canyon. This image from USGS provides a topographical map of the canyon, generated from satellite bathymetry data. These kinds of maps have a variety of applications, including the study of plate tectonics and undersea volcanoes, to name a few.<br><br>

EVL is also applying this technology to the visualization of aerial photography images provided by the <a href='http://www.usgs.gov'>US Geological Survey</a> as part of a homeland defense initiative. In this application, aerial photographs of 133 urban areas are being photographed at a 3-foot resolution. This amounts to a total of approximately 38 Terabytes of image data that JuxtaView must be able to navigate through.<br><br>
