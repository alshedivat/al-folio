The objective of the Virtual Bronzeville Project is to create a virtual model of the history of Bronzeville, Chicago. This model will illustrate Bronzeville&rsquo;s complex social, political, economic, and cultural systems. By using virtual environments, animations, interviews, and GIS data, users will be able to explore this historic area.
