Daydreamer is a VR hybrid environment consisting of two worlds the Real and the Imaginary. The real world exists in the City of Chicago, and the imaginary resides in the mind of the author.<br><br>

&ldquo;We shall increasinlgy live in two worlds, the real and the virtual, and in many realities, both cultural and spiritual&rdquo; (Roy Ascott)
