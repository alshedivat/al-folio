The GeoPad project is an extension of the collaboration of geoscientist and computer scientist initiated with the <a href='http://geowall.geo.lsa.umich.edu/'>GeoWall Consortium</a>. The focus of the GeoPad project is to develop a real-time data gathering system for collaborative field geology.<br><br>

Unlike traditional geological field experience, the GeoPad project aims to mediate fieldwork with advanced visualization and networking technologies - wireless enabled TabletPCs with attached GPS units, digital cameras, microphone headsets, where data can be instantaneously collected, shared and distributed among each other, various sites and remote <a href='http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/continuum/indexmain.html'>&ldquo;data fusion collaboratories&rdquo;</a>. These distant &ldquo;resource centers&rdquo; provide access to large datastores or visualization resources on demand, providing significant enhancement to geological fieldwork, earth science education and traditional data gathering / analysis methods.
