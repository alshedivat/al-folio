Franz Fischnaller presented <em>CityCluster: From the Renaissance to the Gigabits Networking Age</em> in Spain at the Canariasmediafest, October 22- 26, 2002. <em>CityCluster</em>, a collaborative virtual reality art project was developed using the <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/research/template_res_project.php3?indi=210">Ygdrasil (YG)</a> framework. As a result of this project, several new YG modules and an innovative virtual-networking interface called the &lsquo;Meta-Net-Page&rsquo; were developed; &lsquo;Meta-Net-Page&rsquo; is used to navigate and interact with the virtual environment, which substitutes head-tracking for the C-Wall virtual reality display system used during this exhibition.<br><br>

The tenth edition of the Canariasmediafest (International Video and Multimedia Festival of the Canaries) for the first time in its history took place outside of the <a href="http://www.step.es/canarias-infesvideo/cic.htm">Centro Insular de Cultura</a> at the <a href="http://www.rcanaria.es/museoelder/museo_elder.htm">Elder Museum of Science and Technology</a>, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Canaries, Spain. The festival is devoted to the presentation of multimedia and audio-visual works that experiment with the electronic image, focusing on the integration of technology and language. Featured exhibits and awards included: video creation, documentary, educational video, infographics and animation, multimedia, net art and new creators.<br><br>
