In a truly &lsquo;hands on&rsquo; demonstration, a haptics-enhanced virtual reality device now on exhibit at SC&rsquo;02 in Baltimore, shows how surgeons and medical modelers working together in a virtual space can produce precise fitting, pre-fabricated surgical implants without costly molding, casting or sculpting steps.<br><br>

Using PARIS (Personal Augmented Reality Immersive System), a projection-based &lsquo;augmented&rsquo; virtual reality display developed at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), a surgeon and medical modeler can view a three-dimensional model of a patient&rsquo;s computed tomography (CT) data, and collaboratively review, sculpt and &lsquo;virtually&rsquo; build an implant using their hands.<br><br>

PARIS is optimized to allow users to interact with the environment using a variety of tactile input devices. An authentic sensation of the implant sculpting process is achieved using SensAble Technologies&rsquo; PHANTOM force-feedback device. The PARIS display has excellent contrast and variable lighting that allows a user&rsquo;s hands to be seen immersed in the imagery.<br><br>

A medically advanced, albeit labor-intensive and costly method for designing and building pre-surgical implants in virtual reality was developed and implemented at UIC in 1996. This process can correct traumatic head injuries and restore normal facial appearance. Although it revolutionized the still-widely practiced method of fashioning implants in the operating room using heat producing and potentially tissue damaging acrylics, it exists largely as a cost prohibitive option in most patient cases.<br><br>

The digital, networked, collaborative modeling environment aims to eliminate many time-consuming steps and make the surgical procedure widely available. The digital model of the implant can be exported directly to a variety of rapid-prototyping manufacturing modalities, making &lsquo;hands on&rsquo; sculpting, molding, and casting steps unnecessary, and allowing the use of new, state-of-the-art implant materials.<br><br>

The current PARIS prototype employs the Christie Mirage 2000 DLP projector and a double mirror-fold to compactly and brightly illuminate an overhead black screen. Images projected on the black screen are reflected on a half-silvered mirror positioned over the user&rsquo;s desk. Putting his or her hands under the mirrored area, the user can see and interact with the virtual image, or the physical haptic device and/or keyboard. The configuration is well suited to the lighting conditions of a typical office environment, and the device can be easily packed, moved and deployed. The half-silvered mirror display can be raised and lowered over the desktop, so users can either work at their desk or in the virtual-reality space without leaving their offices. PARIS uses EVL-developed collaboration and networking software CAVERNsoft and Quanta, which enable real-time interactions over very-high-speed networks.<br><br>

EVL has been working in cooperation with UIC&rsquo;s Virtual Reality in Medicine Laboratory and Department of Neurosurgery, to develop the collaborative augmented reality environment to provide a precise method to construct and revise pre-surgical cranial implant designs.<br><br>

&ldquo;We want to take a precise procedure and allow medical professionals to consult worldwide,&rdquo; said UIC medical modeler and application collaborator Ray Evenhouse. &ldquo;The tools to model implants in a digital environment are in place. Given the right networking conditions, we could begin routinely produce implants using this method within two years.&rdquo;<br><br>

The PARIS system is on exhibit in the Fakespace Systems booth at SC&rsquo;02 in Baltimore. Fakespace commercializes the EVL-developed CAVE&reg; and ImmersaDesk&reg; systems. EVL receives major funding for PARIS development from National Science Foundation&rsquo;s Major Research Instrumentation and Research Infrastructure awards, and the Department of Energy Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) Visual Interactive Environment for Weapons Simulation (VIEWS) program.
