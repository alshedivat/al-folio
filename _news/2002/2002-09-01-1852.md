The goal of this project is to produce cinematic quality effects in a real-time virtual enviroment. This required research and development to two techniques, <em>baked lighting</em> and <em>shaders</em>.<br><br>

<em>Baked lighting</em> is the technique of rendering lighting into the texture of a 3d object. This allows us to give natural soft shadows and shading to static objects. This technique can also be used to render the occlusive properties of an object.<br><br>

<em>Shaders</em> allows us to have controls of how the object is rendered in real time. We have complete control of the properties of the material, shading, lighting, and distortion.<br><br>

The real time shaders were written using NVidia&rsquo;s CG language.
