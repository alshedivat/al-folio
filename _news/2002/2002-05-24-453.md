The Northwestern Univerisity&rsquo;s Center for Art &amp; Technology hosts the Second Annual Symposium: Art, Technology and Spirituality which features exhibitions, concerts, screenings and presentations by artists, musicians, and scholars.<br><br>

Included in this year&rsquo;s event is <em>Shared Spaces</em>, a collaborative virtual reality installation designed to bring participants together in a mutually meaningful convergence. Participants will be able to meet in the architectural portal called <em>Confluxus</em>. This is the beginning point from which participants are encouraged to move to one of the three virtual project rooms, each created by different artists: <em>Infinite Studio</em> by Todd Margolis, <em>Super Spectacular</em> by Tim Portlock, and <em>Syn.aesthetic</em> by Geoffrey Baum and Keith Miller.
