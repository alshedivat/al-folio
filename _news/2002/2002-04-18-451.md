EVLers, Todd Margolis, Tim Portlock, Geoffrey Allen Baum, and Keith Miller (Applied Interactives, N.F.P.) showcase their collective / collaborative virtual reality artwork &ldquo;Shared Spaces&rdquo;, in the Version>02 exhibition at the <a href="http://www.mcachicago.org">Museum of Contemporary Art</a> April 2002.<br><br>

The Shared Spaces Project is a collaborative virtual reality experience on a <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/research/template_res_project.php3?indi=228">VR Portal</a> installation system. Participants will be able to join into the virtual world through the VR Portal. Through the passage of time, the space evolves into a collective expression of the participants&rsquo; intentions. The virtual objects and activities in the space begin as pre-determined constructs by the artists and develop gradually based on user-input.
