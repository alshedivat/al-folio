Daniel Sandin and Louis H. Kauffman are presenting their collaborative research, <em>Explorations &amp; Visualizations of Higher Dimensional Julia Sets</em>, at ArtSci 2002. This collaboration started in the early 80&rsquo;s with renderings of two-dimensional Julia sets on pre-IBM PC computers such as the TRS 80 laptop and the Datamax UV1 (Z-BOX).<br><br>

Julia sets and other fractals can exist in three and higher dimensions. The collaboration is an actualization of an interest in visualizing these three-dimensional fractals both to understand their behavior and produce interesting images and animation. Since fractals are infinitely crinkly they don&rsquo;t have normals. Further, Julia sets are usually computed in two dimensions by iterating a function hundreds or thousands of times for each pixel. When this concept is extended to three dimensions the number of voxels (3-D pixels) becomes very large.<br><br>

In 1989 John Hart, a master of science graduate student in the computer science department at UIC, hit upon the idea of using a distance estimation technique witch made computation more efficient and provided a basis for determining surface orientation of three and higher dimensional fractal objects. A proof existed for a two-dimensional distance estimation technique and the form of the equations could be extended to higher dimensions. A proof of the three-dimensional distance estimation formulas eluded us until Yumei Dang, a student of Lou Kauffman pursuing a joint Ph.D. in mathematics and computer science, proved the distance estimation formulas to be correct.<br><br>

From this work two animations were produced; a one-minute 35mm stereo movie, &ldquo;A Volume of Two-Dimensional Julia Sets&rdquo; for Siggraph 1990 and a super high definition (2Kx2Kx60Hz) visualization of quaternion (4D) Julia sets for Nippon Telephone and Telegraph&rsquo;s 50th birthday celebration. This collaboration proved useful to the collaborators in several important ways. This collaboration has produced a series of artworks, new computer graphics rendering techniques, and mathematical proofs. In addition it was an excellent test vehicle for evaluating advanced computational and network techniques.<br><br>
