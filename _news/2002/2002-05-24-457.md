<a href="http://artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=963">The Block Museum of Art</a> presents &ldquo;KALI: The Goddess of the Millennium&rdquo; by Franz Fischnaller - From May 24 through June 23, 2002 in conjunction with the NWU Center for Art and Technology Symposium: Art, Technology and Spirituality.<br><br>

Kali is an intense, user-driven, multileveled virtual-reality piece that incorporates advanced technology to create a major interactive art installation. It is a comprehensive experience in the new language of interactive design, aesthetic interpretation of digital information and use of visual design in the virtual environment. Through Kali, the author explores a fusion of digital media, culture, the arts, literature, myth, and cinema.<br><br>

Kali was originally produced  for the exhibition for the exhibition of the Millennium of the city of Berlin: &ldquo;Seven Hills&hellip; Images and Signs of the 21st Century.&rdquo; The show was open to the public from May 14 through October 29, 2000 at the Martin Gropius-Bau exposition building and coordinated by the Berliner Festspiele. The theme was &ldquo;archaeology of the knowledge,&rdquo; and it showcased works of art associated with elements of strength, such as global and cosmic communication, and new alliances between Art and Science. It posed questions and project answers, such as: How will the human species evolve during the next Millennium and what turn can the human, vegetal, and cosmic existence possibly take?<br><br>
