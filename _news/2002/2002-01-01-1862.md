The Vol-a-Tile system is a volume visualization tool for large-scale, time-series scientific datasets rendered on high resolution scalable displays.<br><br>

The datasets can be dynamically processed and retrieved from remote data stores over optical networks using OptiStore - a system that filters raw volumemetric data and produces a secquence of visual objects such as isosurfaces or voxels.<br><br>

Vol-a-Tile focuses on very large volumetric data and time-dependant simulation results, such as ultra high resolution seismic data and microscopy data. The Vol-a-Tile is an application of the <a href='http://www.evl.uic.edu/research/res_project.php3?indi=236'>OptIPuter</a>.
