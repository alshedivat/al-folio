A combination of new projection technology, fast graphics cards and linux PCs have made it possible to provide a stereoscopic projection system that is much more affordable for Earth Science classrooms and research labs. The <em><a href="http://geowall.geo.lsa.umich.edu">GEOWALL</a></em> project makes use of these projection systems to visualize structure and dynamics of the Earth in stereo to aid the understanding of these spatial relationships.<br><br>

Dr. Jason Leigh and Atul Nayak presented new development in <em>Geowall</em> technology in conjunction with the Fall 2002 Seminar Series conducted by Dr. Eric Frost at the Department of <a href="http://www.geology.sdsu.edu">Geological Sciences</a>, San Diego State University. The talk comprised a description of the current state of the <em>Geowall</em> and how it was used in research labs and classrooms to explore the structure and the dynamics of the Earth&rsquo;s interior. Faculty, staff, and students at SDSU were also introduced to the next generation of the <em>Geowall</em> - the <em>Geowall 2.0</em>. This will be the advanced display system for the various endpoints in the bandwidth-dominated computing environment created by the OptIPuter. As part of this effort <em>Geowalls</em> are currently being deployed at the <a href="http://igpp.ucsd.edu">Institute of Geology and Planetary Physics</a> (UCSD) and the Departments of Geological Sciences and <a href="http://www.engineering.sdsu.edu/electrical/">Computer Engineering</a> at SDSU. Geo-scientists will use the <em>GeoWall 2.0</em> to steer simulations and create visualizations to aid their research.
