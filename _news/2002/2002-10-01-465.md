During the summer of 2002, the Electronic Visualization Laboratory and the University of Paris adapted <em>&ldquo;The Multi Mega Book&rdquo;</em> Virtual Reality Renaissance Environment for display using a RAVE VR system. (The RAVE consists of two - 2 meter rear-projection screens, a &lsquo;wand&rsquo; for virtual navigation, as well as free hand control using gesture recognition techniques developed by colleagues at the University of Paris.) <em>The Multi Mega Book</em> database also required significant modification to adapt to the RAVE display environment.<br><br>

The completed RAVE-version of <em>The Multi Mega Book</em> project was displayed October 2002 at the CITE DES SCIENCES (the Villette), Paris, &ldquo;F&ecirc;te de la Science&rdquo; to &ldquo;rave&rdquo; reviews by exhibition attendees and participants.<br><br>

The presentation was coordinated by Professor Patrick Bourdot, a leader of the Gesture and Image Group, Human-Machine Communication Department and Virtual Environment, University of Paris Sud, and made possible by the generous support of the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) initiative.
