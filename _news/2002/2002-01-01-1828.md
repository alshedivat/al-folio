## Please Adjust

With the growing amount of interactive artworks, questions over artistic control and intent have become more important than ever. <em>Please Adjust</em> specifically empowers participants with the ability to create their own visual aesthetic. Four dials on an antique television case allow people to vary the screen image from the extreme minimal to the geometrically complex. However, the final image is not a static &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; model of the image from their heads.<br><br>

Tiny amounts of analog and digital noise permeate through the system to create a jittery effect on the screen. This creates the realization that they are not 100% in control of their creation and that they are actually collaborating with an unknown force-in a broad sense, technology. Just like any collaboration, the more time spent engaged with the work, the better a participant understands the computer&rsquo;s behavior model and the stronger the connection becomes.
