Immedia2002 is presented by entity, the Ann Arbor Electronic Artist Coalition. The annual show has been growing exponentially in participation and attendance in past years, and increased submissions mean we are able to bring you a show that exposes widely varying examples of all types of digital art.<br><br>

The methods and media involved with digital art are still in their infancy, and entity believes that communication among artists is the best way to further the art form and produce better work. To this end, we view the annual exhibition as a means for artists to see what is possible with the medium, meet each other, and share ideas and resources.
