The Shared Spaces project is a collaborative virtual reality experience on a VR Portal installation system. The space is designed to be a community meeting area where participants from varied backgrounds can come together in a tele-immersive environment and cooperate to create a mutually meaningful convergence.<br><br>

These participants will be able to join into the virtual world through the VR Portal at the MCA and from other physically remote VR systems.<br><br>

Through the passage of time, the space evolves into a collective expression of the participants intentions. The virtual objects and activities in the space begin as pre-determined constructs by the artists and gradually develop based on user-input.<br><br>

The virtual environment is sub-divided into three seperate areas accessible from a main entranceway. Participants are first confronted with &ldquo;Confluxus&rdquo;, an architectural portal that reacts to the positions and movements of the users within it by revealing only the parts of the structure that are within users&rsquo; proximity.<br><br>

Within this space, the participants can see each others&rsquo; avatars leaving trails from their wake in the 3D architectural grid.<br><br>

From here, participants are encouraged to move to one of the three virtual project rooms (Infinite Studio, Super Spectacular and Syn.aesthetic).
