&ldquo;plugANDplay&rdquo; is an exhibition which pushes the limits and vagaries of an electronically overwhelmed culture. Each piece is to be simply plugged in and played.<br><br>

EVLers and <a href="http://www.sine.org">sine::apsis experiments</a> members Todd Margolis and Fernando Orellana showcase their work in this exhibition, which runs concurrently at Swanson Cralle: S:N (signal to noise), June 28th-August 10th.<br><br>
