EVL undergraduate researcher Athena Angara discussed her summer internship project with Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), &ldquo;Tele-robotics to Tele-autonomous Robotics for Isotope Production,&rdquo; during NVIDIA&rsquo;s weekly livestream, Community Spotlight: Unlocking Physical AI with Isaac Sim and OpenUSD.<br><br> 
Angara is a senior studying data science.  She spent her summer at the ALCF working on a DOE-funded project that leveraged virtual reality and augmented reality to create digital twins of critical components of robotic arms.  Using Unreal Engine 5 and NVIDIA&rsquo;s Unity, Omniverse, and Isaac Sim, Angara developed an immersive display system with real-time, low latency, and high spatial resolution for remote control processes. She also converted data to ensure accurate representations between these digital platforms.<br><br>
NVIDIA&rsquo;s Omniverse is a real-time 3D graphics collaboration platform.  It has been used for applications in the visual effects and &ldquo;digital twin&rdquo; industrial simulation industries.  Omniverse makes extensive use of the Universal Scene Description format.<br><br>
