This paper presents research on a collaborative learning envrionment in an urban elementary science classroom. The application, called <em>RoomBugs</em>, simulates a dynamic ecosystem of insects within the physical space of a classroom. Using table-mounted tablet computers as &ldquo;sand traps&rdquo; that capture the foot-prints of virtual bugs walking across the screen, participants take on the role of scientists attempting to track and control the imagined insects that exist within their classroom walls. The simulation is designed to create authentic phenomenon without required heavy instrumentation.<br><br>
