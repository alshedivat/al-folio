As an OptIPuter partner, EVL participated at this year&rsquo;s SC06 Conference showcasing SAGE, the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment advancements.  SAGE is specialized middleware that simultaneously enables human-to-human communication and data-sharing communication on variable-sized tiled displays connected via optical networks.  At SC06, SAGES&rsquo;s new network service - &lsquo;Visualcasting&rsquo; that enables two or more users to share application content in sending multi-gigabit streams as required was successfully demonstrated between OptIPuter partners on-site and via remote participation (Dutch Research Consortium / SARA High Performance Networking &amp; Insight Services Group; UIC / EVL and StarLight).<br><br>

SAGE demonstrations took place at the following SC06 exhibit booths:<br>
<ul>
<li>Apple Computer</li>
<li>California Institute of Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) and Center for Earth Observation Applications (CEOA) at University of California San Diego (UCSD)</li>
<li>Pacific Northwest GigaPoP and ResearchChannel (University of Michigan, School of Information)</li>
<li>Purdue University, Envision Center for Data Perceptualization and the Rosen Center for Advanced Computing</li>
</ul><br>

PhD candidate Byungil Jeong&rsquo;s also presented a technical paper discussing SAGE research, &ldquo;High-Performance Dynamic Graphics Streaming for Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment&rdquo;.  EVL co-Director, Jason Leigh presented &ldquo;Global Lambda Visualization Facility and SAGE Visualcasting&rdquo;, and Associate Director, Maxine Brown presented &ldquo;TransLight and GLIF&rdquo;, both from the National LambdaRail SC06 booth on the show floor.
