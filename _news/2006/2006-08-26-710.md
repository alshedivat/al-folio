Curated by: Mark Porter<br>
OPENING: September 7, 5-8pm<br><br>

Sabrina Raaf, UIC Assistant Professor EV, and former EVL MFA candidate Fernando Orellana showcase their artwork with colleagues Shawn Decker, Heidi Kumao, Amy Youngs and Ken Rinaldo at the Glass Curtain Gallery of Columbia College Chicago.<br><br>

These artists play the role of inventor / artist in presenting performative sculpture - each work performing an individual function, whether it is the cycling of ferrofluids or the stirring of ping-pong balls. Some pieces call for viewer interaction while others simply want to be watched. Seemingly self-conscious, each piece expresses a message through its function, beyond what it could as a static object.
