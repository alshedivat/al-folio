&ldquo;Science Grid This Week&rdquo; features the iCluster visualization system developed at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego (UCSD) which uses EVL&rsquo;s software - Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment, or SAGE, designed for the NSF-funded OptIPuter project. SAGE is the underpinnings for the collaborative scientific visualization system, providing the functionality to share high-resolution imagery as well as high-definition video among groups of collaborators at local or remote sites.<br><br>

The network-centered architecture of SAGE allows collaborators to simultaneously run various applications (such as 3D rendering, remote desktop, video streams and 2D maps) on local or remote clusters, and share them by streaming the pixels of each application over ultra-high-speed networks to large tiled displays.<br><br>

The Scripps &lsquo;iCluster&rsquo; is a visualization system that offers a resolution of up to 50 million pixels for the exploration of Earth sciences datasets.  The iCluster consists of 12 30&rdquo; Apple Cinema displays arranged in a three by four grid and powered by a cluster of 7 Apple PowerMac G5 machines. The system is used to monitor real-time streams of data collected by seismic, coastal and environmental sensor networks.
