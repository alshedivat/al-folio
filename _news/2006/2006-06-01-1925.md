SAGE Display Controller is a web based user-interface application designed to access and control the SAGE environment.<br><br>

SAGE, the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment, is a graphics streaming architecture for supporting collaborative scientific visualization environments with potentially hundreds of mega-pixels of contiguous display resolution.<br><br>

The application allows the user to interact with the environment from a standard web browser such as Firefox or Internet explorer.<br><br>

Users can move, resize or close the application windows running on the SAGE environment. The application also allows users to share their desktop on the SAGE display.<br><br>

Please, visit the <a href='http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/sage/sagewebui/documentation.php'>project documentation page</a> on the SAGE website to learn more about Desktop sharing.
