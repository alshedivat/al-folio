EVLers Tom DeFanti, Maxine Brown and Alan Verlo participate in the 6th Annual Global LambdaGrid Workshop. The Research and Applications Working Group, led by Maxine Brown (University of Illinois at Chicago) and Larry Smarr (University of California at San Diego), identifies applications that can benefit from LambdaGrids. These include VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) using radio telescopes situated around the world, SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) for detecting celestrial objects, GLEON (Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network) and CREON (Coral Reef Environmental Observatory Network) that allow the collection and comparison of ecological data, and GLVF (Global Lambda Visualisation Facility) which provides HDTV streaming facilities. LambdaGrids are also key to exploiting the vast amounts of data produced by particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider located at CERN.
