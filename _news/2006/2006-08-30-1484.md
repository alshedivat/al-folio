The goal of this research was to evaluate the usefulness of a wireless custom monitor in measuring real-time finger posture over an extended period of time as the wearer goes about daily life activities. One individual wore the device for 25 continuous hours in the research facility and at home. Initial data analysis methods have been presented to explore different aspects of hand activity over time. Evaluating mean flexion over five minute intervals reveals common hand postures assumed throughout the day, while total joint excursion over longer intervals highlights periods of inactivity associated with sleep or rest, as well as periods of higher intensity activities that can be used to evaluate compliance with physical therapy and home rehabilitation instructions.
