Pan is an interactive visual installation that facilitates a collaborative performance among users.<br><br>

The title of the work is a Korean word that invokes several different meanings: plate, disk, place, stage. The reference to a plate corresponds to the interface used in the work, while simultaneously referencing a Korean tradition - the designation of a public performance space within the community that is for eyeryone&rsquo;s use, and a gathering place for performance.<br><br>

The installation invites the audience to participate in its synthetic movement and provides a space for community interaction. By interacting with a tangible interface, the installation renders tabletops with a new aesthetic that is generative and organic. Interactive activities are interpreted as softened dynamics visually by a generic particle system algorithm. The three interfaces are capable of network communication to form an interconnection among participants.
