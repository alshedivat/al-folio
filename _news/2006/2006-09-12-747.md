EVL&rsquo;s Ph.D. student, Xun Luo presented his latest research in machine learning and artificial intelligence in mobile computing / wearable systems, &ldquo;Active Lifestyles Software&rdquo; at the Motorola Symposium on Software, System and Simulation (S3&rsquo;2006).<br><br>

Xun&rsquo;s presentation addressed the research problem of delivering machine intelligence and scalable computation for mobile device users. Several proof-of-concepts that delivered machine intelligence to the Motorola handsets, including a smart calendar suite that could summarize and visualize daily activities by sensor fusion, and Active Lifestyle wristband that changes visualization mode with the wearer&rsquo;s fitness were also demonstrated.
