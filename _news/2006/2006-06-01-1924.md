&ldquo;Passing Excellence&rdquo; is an artistic visualization research project centered on the world famous architectural ensemble <a href='http://kizhi.karelia.ru/'>Kizhi</a>.<br><br>

The Kizhi Pogost, located on an island in Lake Onega (Karelia, Russia) is a historically significant architectural complex with a valuable collection of artifacts and icons, built in harmony with the surrounding landscape as an authentic museum of ancient wood building tradition.<br><br>

The Kizhi Pogost is an outstanding example of medieval and post-medieval orthodox settlements, preserving a concentration of masterpieces of Russian heritage. The site is currently included in the List of Most Endangered Sites of the World Monuments Watch protected by World Heritage List of UNESCO.<br><br>

The &ldquo;Passing Excellence&rdquo; research project focuses upon developing interactive visualizations of the deteriorating site - both capturing the current state of the ensemble, as well as attempting to reconstruct historical architectural stages of building exteriors and interior elements / artifacts beginning from the 15th Century up to the 21st Century.<br><br>

The &ldquo;Passing Excellence&rdquo; visualization is based on detailed photographs, architectural and geometric measurements, textural data, video surveys and resources from the Kizhi State Open-Air Museum archives; 3-dimensional models are being constructed using Autodesk Maya. The application development uses Electro, an easy-to-use scripting system for the development of interactive 3-D applications spanning multiple processors and displays such as tiled display devices or desktop systems.<br><br>

This project hopes to preserve the Kizhi ensemble&rsquo;s cultural heritage and historical significance by creating a virtual reconstruction of the site and sharing the application with cultural institutions, museums, researchers and educators worldwide.<br><br>

The project is being developed in collaboration with a computer science researcher Robert Kooima, a specialist in the field of data visualization and real-time 3D graphics in Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL).
