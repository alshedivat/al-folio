This workshop explored possible development pathways for the CoreWall Suite of Applications - an  NSF-funded project developinging a basic suite of data integration and visualization applications for broad use in the ocean, lake, continental, and ice &ldquo;coring&rdquo; communities.<br><br>

To ensure that the appropriate specifications and requirements of the coring communities were being established, this workshop brought together 50 participants from a variety of ocean and lake (continental) drilling groups (IODP, ICDP, ANDRILL), databases (PetDB, SedDB, PaleoStrat),application developers (GeoMapApp, Match), web portals  (CHRONOS), educators, and other interested scientists.
