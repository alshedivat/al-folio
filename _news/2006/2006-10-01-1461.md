LambdaGrid applications as typified by data-intensive collaborative visualization are likely to be the first users of terabit-level networking. This paper features a main enabler of collaborative visualization over LambdaGrid, the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment (SAGE) in particular, and anticipates the future needs of LambdaGrid applications in general. We present a scalable architecture called LambdaBridge to &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; LambdaGrid applications with the terabit optical core networks.<br><br>

LambdaBridge will provision and control predictable-performance networks for end-systems (i.e. Grid clusters) using on-demand lambda / VLAN provisioning and end-system traffic shaping.<br><br>

The chief contribution of LambdaBridge is a deep understanding of how to synergistically bridge provisionable networks, end-systems, and future generation distributed terabit applications. This paper also introduces Scalable Visualcasting - a multicasting service for LambdaGrid that incorporates IP multicasting and optical multicasting.
