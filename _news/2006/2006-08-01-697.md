The Ygdrasil website at <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/yg">www.evl.uic.edu/yg</a> has been completely reworked.<br><br>

There is now a complete user guide that covers everything from installation to scripting and networking.<br><br>

The site includes a reworked scripting tutorial and a graphical interface tutorial with over 60 screen shots.<br><br>

And, there is now a forum to support the Ygdrasil user community.<br><br>

This will be an ideal place for questions and feedback about all subjects including installation, configuration, and scripting.<br><br>

Also, the forum will serve as a collection point for impressions and feedback about the new graphical interface.<br><br>

<strong>Ygdrasil 0.4.3</strong><br><br>

The latest release of Ygdrasil allows multiple cluster nodes running CAVElib distribution to form a single client.<br><br>

The Bergen client now uses the OSC protocol for seamless communication with either the Bergen server or MaxMSP / Supercollider servers.<br><br>

This release also includes a number of improvements such as:<br>
<ul>
<li>A 2-sided lighting model</li>
<li>A 2-pass rendering mechanism</li>
<li>Sounds that pause and restart when under switches</li>
<li>A revised grabNavigator that allows users to temporarily override navigation</li>
</ul>
