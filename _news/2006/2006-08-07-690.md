EVL Ph.D. student Yu-Chung Chen will present EVL&rsquo;s Corelyzer project during a poster session at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 2006) in San Francisco, California, August 7-11.<br><br>

In October 2006, Corelyzer will be deployed at the ANDRILL project&rsquo;s McMurdo expedition station. ANDRILL is the newest geological drilling program to recover stratigraphic records from the Antarctic region.<br><br>

Corelyzer is being developed by the University of Illinois at Chicago&rsquo;s Electronic Visualization Laboratory with funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF).
