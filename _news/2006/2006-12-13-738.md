EVL Visiting Research Assistant Professor, Luc Renambot presented EVL&rsquo;s advanced visualiztion and networking research to colleagues and students of the PRIUS (Pacific Rim International University) Program, Osaka Japan. Invited by Osaka University and the PRIUS Program, Dr. Renambot&rsquo;s talk, &ldquo;Advanced Visualization and Collaboration Research over High-Speed Networks&rdquo; discussed EVL&rsquo;s vision for the creation of persistent internationally distributed collaboration facilities, including high-performance computing, advanced visualization, and one-of-kind instruments, to foster knowledge and discoveries for scientific advancement, and to engage students as they prepare for the global workforce. The foundations of these collaborative environments are among grid computing, optical networks (lambda grid), and high-resolution visualization.<br><br>

The PRIUS project, promoted by Osaka University, aims to foster human resources capable of taking leadership with international perspective and reinforce the Japanese international competitive power.
