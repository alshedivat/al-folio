<em>Kizhi - Passing Excellence</em> is a research project sponsored by OVCR-AAH grant to develop a real-time large scale high-resolution visualization of the world famous architectural ensemble <em>Kizhi</em>.<br><br>

The Kizhi Pogost is located on an island in Lake Onega in northern Karelia in Russia. It is an authentic museum of an ancient wood building tradition, an outstanding example of medieval and post-medieval orthodox settlements, which presents a unique artistic achievement. This ensemble preserves a concentration of masterpieces of the Russian heritage and is included in the List of Most Endangered Sites of the World Monuments Watch protected by World Heritage List of UNESCO.<br><br>

The focus of this project is to create an interactive visualization of the history of Kizhi beginning at the 14th Century and going through today in the 21st Century. The project will be created using an application development environment Electro designed for use on both cluster-driven tiled displays and desktop systems. Electro provides an easy-to-use scripting system for interactive 3D and 2D applications spanning multiple processors and displays.
