Chicago - The day is coming when you&rsquo;ll talk to a friend, even shake his hand and offer him a seat - from a city hundreds of miles away.<br><br>

A new and improved Internet, now under development in labs around the globe, will offer holographic images and go beyond the flat screen in other ways, offering consumers an array of products that can only be imagined right now. You could find yourself in the middle of a virtual reality NASCAR race, for example. Or perhaps you&rsquo;ll become a detective trying to solve a three-dimensional mystery.<br><br>

In other words, it isn&rsquo;t your father&rsquo;s Internet.<br><br>

And the gateway through which the network will connect is right here in Chicago.
