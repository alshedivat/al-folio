From the telegraph to modern live satellite feeds, a flattening of time and space has occurred via technologies concerned with communication and media. This occurrence prompted Paul Virilio to speculate upon the concept of chronoscopic time, a viewpoint based upon the speed of light as a replacement for prior conceptions of the passage of time chronologically. In his formulation, a new realization utilizing the photographic metaphor of underexposed - exposed - overexposed is substituted for the recognizable past - present - future structure.<br><br>

These pieces attempt to visually explore this possibility.<br><br>

Photographed with a single camera, the object was placed upon a turntable and photographed from different angles to produce the 180&deg; view. The prosthetic and &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; head deliberately looks back into the past, forward into the future and direct gaze upon the viewer in the present.<br><br>

Multiple video cameras placed at different angles and heights surround the subject and capture simultaneously. The resulting frames are superimposed upon each other and re-constructed through post-production techniques. The attempt further illustrates the flattening of time and space and the perceptible conjoining of these states by allowing the viewer to see from multiple vantages simultaneously.
