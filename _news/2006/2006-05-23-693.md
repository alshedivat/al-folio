Andrew Johnson gave a presentation and series of demonstrations on EVL&rsquo;s high resolution and 3D display technology to the Chicago Map Society during their visit to EVL.<br><br>

Founded in 1976, the Chicago Map Society is the oldest map society in North America. Meetings are held during the academic year at the Newberry Library. Meetings begin with an informal social half-hour, followed by a 45-minute presentation and a brief discussion. The society occasionally arranges excursions to map libraries and often dedicates one meeting a year as a time for members to share their own maps with the group.
