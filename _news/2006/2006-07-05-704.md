<em>Rutopia 2</em>, virtual walk-through video animation was presented at the <em><a href="http://www.graphicslink.co.uk/IV06/">7th International Symposium of Computer Animation and Visual Effects, IV06-CAVE</a></em>.<br><br>

This symposium was designed to provide a forum to the researchers, educators, and practitioners in this field to share their opinions.<br><br>

The symposium aimed to identify presentations on Key research issues, review the current state-of-the-art developments, and outline future directions.<br><br>

Embedded with the current research being undertaken in industry and academia, this symposium provided coverage of the salient aspects and sub-areas of Computer Animation within the field of visualisation, computer generated graphics, and beyond.<br><br>

<em><a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/animagina/rutopia/rutopia2">Rutopia 2</a></em> explores the aesthetics of virtual art in its relationship with the art of painting and Russian folk arts, such as Palekh, Khokhloma, Dymkovo toys, Fedoskino and Lubok.<br><br>

The aesthetics of <em>Rutopia 2</em> is based upon their principles of composition, bright colors, simplified shapes, and material culture. It serves as a framing device to unite the concepts of the network tree, public sculpture, and futuristic design while maintaining aesthetics principles of the previous centuries.<br><br>

In addition, the development of tile display devices/systems and their potential, such as high-resolution, segmentation, modularity, and parallel computing, contributed in the conceptualization of <em>Rutopia 2</em>.
