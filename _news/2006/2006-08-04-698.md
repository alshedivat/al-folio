<strong>You Are Here</strong><br>
8 - 10pm, Aug 4, 2006<br>
1646 N. Bosworth<br><br>

Drew Browning and Annette Barbier&rsquo;s projection onto the facade of the gallery building takes image information from the nearby expressway to create an abstracted meditation on our frenetic pace of travel.<br><br>

The title of the work plays on the common kiosk guide map dot and familiar spiritual phrase &ldquo;Be Here Now&rdquo; (Ram Dass), reflecting on the pace of our
existence and gently questioning whether our obsession with speed is really getting us anywhere.<br><br>

Best viewed looking NW from the north bound lanes of the Kennedy Expressway (I-94) at North Ave.
