EVL Co-Director Dan Sandin presents his electronic artwork at the Gene Siskel Film Center, Thursday, March 9, 6:00pm. Sandin is among the leading figures in the history of image-based electronic art - with the development of the Sandin Image Processor (IP), the EV program and EVL at UIC, and CAVE virtual reality theater, Sandin has played a role in the growth of video art, interactive video, immersive electronic environments, video game technologies, virtual reality, and the open source movement for nearly 4 decades.<br><br>

Sandin will provide a glimpse of his career in a 60 minute multimedia show featuring rare tapes from his earliest days with video and examples of his most recent work.<br><br>

This presentation is part of FRAY, a three-part mini-series and conference focusing on time, screen and code based experimental new media art. FRAY is organized by The School of the Art Institute of Chicago&rsquo;s Film, Video and New Media Department.<br><br>
