Co-Director Jason Leigh represents EVL&rsquo;s latest advanced networking research at The International Workshop on Protocols for Fast Long-Distance Networks in Nara Japan. During the workshop&rsquo;s &lsquo;Implementation Session&rsquo;, the paper &ldquo;A Case for UDP offload Engines in LambdaGrids&rdquo; authored by V. Vishwanath, P. Balaji*, W. Feng**, J. Leigh, and D. K. Panda* was presented and discussed. The focus of this publication was upon the design and development of an emulated UDP Offload Engine (UOE) based on the Chelsio T110 TOE; a solution which would transparently improve the performance for existing UDP / IP-based applications.<br><br>

This is the second in the series of four workshops that EVL has attended and participated.<br><br>
