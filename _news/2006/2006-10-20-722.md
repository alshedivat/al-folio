UNFOLDING SPACE<br><br>

The tridimensional shadow of a four dimensional textured grid unfolds in a virtual reality environment. Julieta Aguilera places the viewer within the abstract version of a walk into a forest, at the precise moment that light causes foliage and shadows to merge into a unified pattern.<br><br>
