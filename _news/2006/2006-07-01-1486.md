This paper presents the LambdaTable, a tabletop display that employs tiled LCD monitors to significantly improve resolution over single display or projector systems. It supports multi-modal interaction with applications and copresent users by combining extremely high visual resolution with uniquely identified, special purpose camera tracked physical interface devices, all within a large multiuser tabletop environment.<br><br>

In this paper we investigate the Fitts Law properties of this system, with particular emphasis on target acquisition across large distances. We also discuss the LambdaTable&rsquo;s&trade; applications for solving emerging needs within the scientific visualization and emergency response domains.
