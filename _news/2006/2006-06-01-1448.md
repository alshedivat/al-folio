HelioRoom simulates the orbital motion of the planets in the Solar system on a set of synchronized computer displays situated on the walls of the classroom, with planets &ldquo;orbiting&rdquo; around the periphery of the room. Third grade students used the application for a problem-solving activity requiring the collection of evidence in support of theories concerning the identity of planets whose size and surface characteristics were intentionally obscured.
