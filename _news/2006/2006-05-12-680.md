<strong>FEATURED ARTISTS / WORK:</strong><br><br>

<strong><em>skin</em></strong>, by Helen-Nicole Kostis<br>
<a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/eleni/thesis">www.evl.uic.edu/eleni/thesis</a><br>
An interactive, skin-derived media installation that explores the intersection of the body as landscape / mindscape and the body&rsquo;s own traces of touch.<br><br>

<strong><em>Omniuum</em></strong>, by Hyeyun Park<br>
<a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/milg/omniuum">www.evl.uic.edu/milg/omniuum</a><br>
Human being is, regardless of time and space over the history, destined to be a creature that exists in the circumstances where interactions with one another and the rest of the world are essential. In Omniuum, the relationship among human beings lived based on mutuality will be visualized by blurring the boundaries of time and space to represent the nature of a space-time continuum of the universe.<br><br>

<strong><em>[Un] Limited Edition - Fragments on Consumerism</em></strong>, by Poliana Tassini<br>
[Un] Limited Edition - Fragments on Consumerism, is a CG animation whose unconventional narrative unfolds around key concepts connected to the phenomenon of consumerism. Comprised of 9 animated fragments, the piece is designed to portray the many facets of consumerism, dealing with the multidimensionality of consuming experience, within which consumers feel constrained and controlled, yet liberated and sovereign. Developed in Alias Maya software, the piece attempts to portray the interminable and controversial discussion about consumption, consumerism and what it means to be human within the madness, irrationality and hysteria of a materialist consumer society.<br><br>

<strong><em>[pan]</em></strong>, by Sangyoon Lee<br>
[pan] is a Korean word invoking several different meanings, such as: plate, disk, place, stage. By interacting with three forms of interface, the visual installation computers render tabletops as newly generative organic aesthetics.<br><br>

<strong><em>Cue</em></strong>, by Tina Shah<br>
<a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/tinas/cue">www.evl.uic.edu/tinas/cue</a><br>
In all of us we have stored away memories that can be conjured up with the slightest trigger. Cue is an abstraction on the visual processing experienced during moments of recollection. By exploring relationships between the artist&rsquo;s past episodes and images captured in the exhibition space, a unique perspective is created on the connections we share with our own memories.
