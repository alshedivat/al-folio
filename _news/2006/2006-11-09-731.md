EVL MFA candidate, Stephen Cady, will be exhibiting <em>Chronoscopic</em> at the The Reno Interdisciplinary Festival of New Media (<a href="http://www.unr.edu/art/RIFNM.html">RIFNM</a>), November 9th through December 15th, 2006.<br><br>

The 1st Reno Interdisciplinary Festival of New Media (RIFNM 06) highlights an international selection of work by graduate and PhD students working with new digital technologies for the creation of art. Artists working in and across disciplines were invited to submit works to be considered for five interrelated events / venues: exhibit, netart, perform, project (full-dome) and present. The resulting festival schedule of events presents a unique opportunity to directly experience innovative work being created by a diversity of emerging artists exploring digital systems for visual and experiential production.
