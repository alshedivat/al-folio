Los Angeles, CA - Japan&rsquo;s Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), in collaboration with the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) and the University of Southern California (USC) School of Cinema-Television, successfully demonstrated Super High Definition (SHD) full motion digital imagery streaming in real time from a server in Chicago to a projector in Los Angeles.<br><br>

This was the world&rsquo;s first successful trial of long-distance transmission of SHD content over general-purpose IP networks.<br><br>

SHD has four times the resolution of HDTV, and 24 times the resolution of standard definition video. Transmission of SHD via network requires sustainable high-speed connectivity of 1 Gbps over multiple &ldquo;hops&rdquo; without significant packet loss, delay or jitter.<br><br>

The demonstration, done as part of Internet2&rsquo;s Fall 2002 Members Meeting in Los Angeles October 28-29, shows the potential for super high performance imaging and visualization applications over very high-speed networks.<br><br>

The content, 3840 x 2048 SHD video, came from scientific instruments, computer graphics simulations, digitally scanned motion-picture films and digital still cameras. The imagery was successfully streamed from an NTT content server at StarLight, the National Science Foundation-sponsored optical exchange for advanced networks in Chicago, over the Internet2 Abilene backbone, to the USC Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts.<br><br>

The content, pre-compressed to 200-400 Mbps using an experimental JPEG 2000 SHD codec, was received in Zemeckis Center by an NTT real time decoder, then fed to NTT&rsquo;s prototype SHD frame-buffer and eight megapixel full-color D-ILA projector for display on a large screen.<br><br>

Featured content included &ldquo;A Diamond of Quaternionic Julia Sets&rdquo; by Dan Sandin of EVL / UIC; &ldquo;Billy Goat&rdquo; by Kleiser Walczak Construction Company; &ldquo;Voyage From Earth to the Virgo Cluster&rdquo; and &ldquo;Flight to the Milky Way Core&rdquo; by Donna Cox, Bob Patterson and Stuart Levy of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; &ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s Memory&rdquo; by NTT Network Innovation Labs; and, &ldquo;Blue Caviar&rdquo; by Mikael Forsberg of the USC Cinema-Television School.<br><br>
