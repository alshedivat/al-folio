<em>EVL provides technology leadership for Virtual School of Computational Science and Engineering</em><br><br>

EVL&rsquo;s Cyber-commons classroom concept served as the  blueprint for hosting of the multi-site Virtual School between the University of Illinois&rsquo; National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), University of Michigan, and the Ohio Supercomputer Center. Collaborators served as satellite hosts for the Great Lakes Consortium &ldquo;Virtual School of Computational Science and Engineering: Summer School 2009: Many-Core Processors for Science and Engineering Applications,&rdquo; providing high-definition streaming video to enable students to participate remotely from multiple locations.<br><br>

The course provides graduate students the opportunity to gain knowledge and hands-on experience in developing applications software for many-core processors with massively parallel computing resources with access to to a 32-node cluster at NCSA. Goals for the course include understanding algorithm styles suitable for accelerators, architectural performance considerations to developing applications, and expanded computational thinking skills for accelerating applications in science and engineering.<br><br>

See the document at the right of this page for additional detail on t technology design developed by EVL.
