EVL researcher, Luc Renambot participates in the transmission of high definition imagery of the total solar eclipse between the University of Illinois at Chicago and Amsterdam&rsquo;s SARA Computing and Networking Services in collaboration with our colleagues at Keio DMC, Japan.<br><br>

Within the context of the <a href="http://www.astronomy2009.org">International Year of astronomy 2009</a>, Keio University captured the total solar eclipse of July 22nd. HD video imagery (motion-picture XD-CAM) was transmitted from Wuhan and Shanghai, China, and from Amami, Japan (southern islands). High-resolution still images recorded at each location (Nikon D3 with fish-eye lens) were also broadcast. This rare event was also shown in several dome theaters and via internet video streams.
