Our paper _Approximate inference by broadening the support of the likelihood_ has been accepted for presentation at the 
[5th Symposium on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference](http://approximateinference.org/). 
This is joint work with Assistant Professor Michael C. Hughes and Mathematics Ph.D. student Martin Buck.
