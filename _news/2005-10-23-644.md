Visiting Research Assitant Professor, Luc Renambot and PhD Student, Byungil Jeong participate in this year&rsquo;s IEEE InfoVis05 Symposium to present EVL&rsquo;s latest developments for SAGE: Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment. SAGE allows local and distributed groups of researchers to work together on large amounts of distributed heterogeneous datasets. It provides an intuitive interface for moving and resizing graphics on an 11x5 tiled display with a total resolution of 100 megapixels tiled display - EVL&rsquo;s LambdaVision.
