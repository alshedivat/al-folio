EVLers Greg Dawe and Chris Scharver join EVL collaborators FakeSpace Systems, Inc. to showcase the PARIS&trade; production prototype at the Eleventh Annual Medicine Meets Virtual Relaity Conference (MMVR).<br><br>

Using PARIS (Personal Augmented Reality Immersive System), a projection-based &lsquo;augmented&rsquo; virtual reality display, enhanced with haptics or forced-feedback device will demonstrate how surgeons and medical modelers working together in a virtual space can produce precise fitting, pre-fabricated surgical implants without costly molding, casting or sculpting steps. EVL has been working in cooperation with UIC&rsquo;s Virtual Reality in Medicine Laboratory and Department of Neurosurgery, to develop the collaborative augmented reality environment to provide a precise method to construct and revise pre-surgical cranial implant designs.<br><br>

The current PARIS prototype employs the Christie Mirage 2000 DLP projector and a double mirror-fold to compactly and brightly illuminate an overhead black screen. Images projected on the black screen are reflected on a half-silvered mirror positioned over the user&rsquo;s desk. Putting his or her hands under the mirrored area, the user can see and interact with the virtual image, or the physical haptic device and/or keyboard. The configuration is well suited to the lighting conditions of a typical office environment, and the device can be easily packed, moved and deployed. The half-silvered mirror display can be raised and lowered over the desktop, so users can either work at their desk or in the virtual-reality space without leaving their offices. PARIS uses EVL-developed collaboration and networking software CAVERNsoft and Quanta, which enable real-time interactions over very-high-speed networks.
