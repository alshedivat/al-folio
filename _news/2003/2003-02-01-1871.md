A year-long collaboration between artists from the US and Vietnam culminates in &ldquo;River of Many Sides&rdquo;. This interactive media performance consists of a virtual environment, which brings people together in networked contexts and which provides a context for performance as well as the occasion for individual exploration. &ldquo;River of Many Sides&rdquo; addresses ideas of conflict and cooperation, powerful complementary forces in our culture at large and in the life of the individual.<br><br>

The metaphor of the river journey reflects our countries&rsquo; common history and how that history has shaped the identities of both. This compelling experience addresses concepts of cultural understanding using interactive computer systems and features live performers interacting with audio and visual environments, with audience participation at key points of the experience. Presented at the University of Illinois at Chicago, UIC Theater, June 2004 by <strong>ArtSynergy</strong>.<br><br>
