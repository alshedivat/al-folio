Quanta is a cross-platform adaptive networking toolkit for supporting the data delivery requirements of interactive and bandwidth intensive applications, such as Amplified Collaboration Environments.<br><br>

One of the unique goals of Quanta is to provide applications with the ability to provision optical pathways (commonly referred to as Lambdas) in dedicated photonic networks.<br><br>

This paper will introduce Quanta&rsquo;s architecture and capabilities, with particular attention given to its aggressive and predictable high performance data transport scheme called Reliable Blast UDP (RBUDP). We provide an analytical model to predict RBUDP&rsquo;s performance and compare the results of our model against experimental results performed over a high speed wide-area network.
