At this year&rsquo;s III Jornada en.red.ando Conference on &lsquo;Building the Virtual Space&rsquo;, Daniel J. Sandin, Director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL), professor in the Art and Design School at the University of Illinois in Chicago (UIC) and an adjunct professor at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, will be running a real-time, networked demonstration of his CAVE art application <em>Looking for Water</em> between Chicago, New York, Barcelona and Umea, Sweden. In addition, Sandin will present a lecture on the relationships between work groups in a virtual reality environment.<br><br>

en.red.ando&rsquo;s One Day Conference will focus on how to organize virtual spaces in such a way that they facilitate cognitive and learning processes. In addition it will take a look at how to generate knowledge on the Net through group work and the technology needed to do this.<br><br>

en.red.ando&rsquo;s III One Day Conference will also have an online phase for reflection and debate called GC-Red: Gesti&oacute;n de Conocimiento en Red based on en.medi@ - a technology developed by en.red.ando for the construction of intelligent networks. GC-Red is a space open to all internauts interested in getting to know and debating the subject of online knowledge management and, more specifically, the main subjects to be dealt with during en.red.ando&rsquo;s III One Day Conference: collaborative virtual environments, the kind of learning (if any) that takes place there and the &ldquo;export&rdquo; of these cyberspace experiences into the real world. Internauts are invited to do this in the company of a large group of multi-disciplinary professionals from all over the world.<br><br>

The aim of en.red.ando&rsquo;s III One Day Conference is to put Spanish companies, organizations and administrations in touch with cutting-edge research into the Information Society. The conference provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the evolution of the Net and examine future challenges. The fact that at these conferences, world leaders in Internet research meet publicly to present their findings and share experiences, makes them unique both in Spain and in the rest of Europe.
