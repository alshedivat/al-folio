This paper describes the OptIPuter&rsquo;s networking model and the visualization tools that are being developed to take advantage of the model. The model proposes the use of photonic switches to direct light through optical networks to create distributed computing pipelines for supporting large scale, interactive data exploration. This paper also describes a way to implement extremely high bandwidth multicasting over photonic networks to support high resolution graphics distribution in collaborative work involving large scale data.
