As part of the &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; exhibition of advanced technologies at New York&rsquo;s First Annual Cyberspace Conference &amp; Exposition, Dr. Leigh demonstrated several educational applications on a <em>GeoWall</em> system. Joined by colleague and collaborator, Paul Morin from the University of Minnesota, children and their families had the opportunity to experience 3D stereo visualizations of geological data, previously accessible only via textbook representations.<br><br>

For EVL, the goal of the Urban Cyberspace event was to showcase the emerging technology of <em>Geowall</em>, thus demonstrating how these systems may be implemented to transform educational instruction.
