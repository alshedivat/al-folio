m.b is an interactive VR project in the CAVE.<br><br>

Sound plays an increasingly varied and ubiquitous role in CAVE user interaction. In this VR project sound is used as a different interactive medium. The user will first experience a virtual gallery full of playful mobiles that are hanging from the ceiling. The user can experience the movement of each mobile in the virtual gallery by generating a sound.<br><br>
