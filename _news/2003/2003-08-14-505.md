The Museum of Science &amp; Industry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Experiments&hellip; Science + Art&rdquo; program showcases Chicago performing and visual artists as they invent new ways to illustrate and enjoy science through compelling live performances and interactive installations.<br><br>

&ldquo;Waiting In Line&rdquo; by Drew Browning and Annette Barbier is among the interactive installations showcased during this event. &ldquo;Waiting In Line&rdquo; is an interactive computer installation of visually rich, graphical representations of waveforms. The exhibit encourages those waiting in line in the Museum of Science &amp; Industry&rsquo;s Great Hall to participate in creating a series of Lissajou figures, a pattern of criss-cross lines often used in science fiction movies of the 1950&rsquo;s. The images will be displayed on a large nine-screen video matrix. As guests enter the Museum, they will receive two sheets of colored paper used to control the horizontal and vertical frequencies and create complex, changing patterns.
