<em>&ldquo;Inside_Out&rdquo; is a networked dance application combining the physical space with the virtual space with a live broadcast of the performances over a high speed network. The application features an experimental optical tracking system to track participants movements within the space displayed on a passive stereo projection screen. The performance portion of the thesis show will feature Robynne Gravenhorst of the Anatomical Theatre and LeAnne Vancil, Nadine Lollino, Lyndsae Rinio, and Katie Wells. Sound Design by Joe Reitzer.</em><br><br>
