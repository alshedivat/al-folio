<em>The Creation</em> is a virtual reality art piece that simulates the very first stage of the Creation of the world.<br><br>

The user can interact with each of the eight signs of divination on the plate, which symbolizes the universe. Each sign turns into one of the four faces of the world and a corresponding holy guardian animal such as a Tiger, Dragon, Phoenix, and Turtle. Once the world is created, one can interact with these holy animals by throwing stones into one of the four faces of the world.
