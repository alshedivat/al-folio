<em>Waiting In Line</em> is an interactive computer installation of visually rich, graphical representations of waveforms.<br><br>

Participants interactively create a series of Lissajous figures, a pattern of lines reminiscent of special effect imagery used in science fiction movies of the 1950&rsquo;s. The resulting images are displayed on a large scale projection screen.<br><br>

The horizontal and vertical frequencies of complex, ever-changing waveforms are controlled by participants brandishing two contrasting colored placards, which in varying amounts, yield the resulting forms.<br><br>

Designed for a museum setting, <em>Waiting In Line</em> aims to engage museum goers in the installation while &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; to enter a main exhibition space.
