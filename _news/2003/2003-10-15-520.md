Franz Fischnaller, creator of the virtual reality and high-speed networking project <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/research/res_project.php3?indi=230"><em>CityCluster</em></a> - &ldquo;From the Renaissance to the Megabyte Networking Age&rdquo;, will be presenting his work at VSMM2003.<br><br>

This year marks the ninth edition of the VSMM Conference, which continues to push the boundaries of Virtual Reality and Multimedia research with the theme &ldquo;Hybrid Realities: Art, Technology, and the Human Factor&rdquo;. VSMM 2003 is being held for the first time in Canada, in the cosmopolitan City of Montreal. This year&rsquo;s conference will combine some popular sessions from past conferences with current fields of special interest, adding a special focus on the human factor. Hexagram, the Institute for Research and Creation in Media Arts and Technologies, is hosting VSMM2003 which will take place in the Science Center of Montreal, in the historic Old Port of Montreal.
