Andrew Johnson gave a tutorial &ldquo;Towards the Holodeck: Advanced Visualization and Collaboration Environments&rdquo; at UIC as part of the Newberry Library&rsquo;s Teachers and Scholars Program.<br><br>

Chicago Teachers as Scholars (TAS) is a series of content-based professional development seminars for Chicago Public School teachers. This program is offered by the Newberry Library in partnership with the Chicago Public Schools Teachers Academy for Professional Development and the Graduate College of the University of Illinois at Chicago.<br><br>

The primary goal of TAS seminars is to improve the knowledge base of CPS teachers in the subjects they teach. These seminars reconnect teachers with the world of scholarship and keep them aware of recent scholarly developments in their fields. In addition, the seminars introduce teachers to the Newberry Library, a cultural institution that can sustain learning for them and their students. Seminars allow teachers to study and discuss specific topics in the humanities and sciences with their colleagues and an established scholar/teacher. Each two-day seminar is designed to allow teachers time to use one of the world&rsquo;s premier research facilities to enhance their classroom teaching. Past participants of the program have expressed tremendous enthusiasm for the intellectual rigor of the seminars and the stimulating discussions with seminar leaders and their fellow teachers.<br><br>

Seminars begin at 9:00 a.m. and end at 3:00 p.m. each day. Teachers are required to attend both days of the seminars for which they are enrolled. Seminars are conducted during the work week, with substitute coverage provided by the CPS Teachers Academy for Professional Development.<br><br>

This collaboration between the Newberry Library, UIC, and Chicago Public Schools enhances participants&rsquo; classroom instruction by nourishing their interest in their disciplines and their love of learning. These benefits do not end when a seminar is over. After completing their seminars, TAS participants are warmly welcomed into the Newberry&rsquo;s community of learners. In addition, they receive special notices of ongoing opportunities to attend stimulating public programs and workshops.
