A new student book to teach mathematics for grades 5-8 entitled <em>Cryptoclub - Using Mathematics to Make and Break Secret Codes</em> is published by AK Peters Inc. in 2006. This research work is an ongoing collaborative project between Daria Tsoupikova, EVL and Vera Pless, Department of Mathematics and Janet Beissinger from the Institute for Math and Science Education at UIC.<br><br>

The goal of the research project is to develop middle-grade mathematics materials that teach cryptography, the science of sending secret messages.<br><br>

The project is sponsored in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation and includes the <a href='http://www.cryptoclub.org/'>Cryptoclub web site</a>, an  online community for children, students, and teachers interested in Cryptography.
