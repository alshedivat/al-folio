Amplified Collaboration Environments (ACEs) are integrated ubiquitous tools and environments that support collaborative scientific investigation using advanced computation and visualization technologies. ACE, such as the Continuum, adapt information to be optimally displayed using a variety of technologies such as multi-site video conferencing, interactive stereoscopic computer graphics, and high-resolution tiled displays backed by clusters of PCs connected over multi gigabit networks. The goal of this research is to enhance collaboration among distantly located teams of experts gathered to intensively solve problems. Human factors study over ACEs is intended to understand interaction among distributed teams of people working in the display-rich environments. An exploratory design study was conducted to evaluate how small groups of people in distributed Continuum spaces perform an information discovery and knowledge crystallization tasks using varying technology configurations. The goal of this design study was to explore design issues to enhance collaboration in ACEs and to provide guidance to designers and facilitators of ACEs.<br><br>

This dissertation describes the design concept of ACEs, the findings from user study, and the analysis of shared workspace model for ACEs.
