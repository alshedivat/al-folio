The Student Leadership and Volunteer / Student Development Services named EVL MS Graduate Student <a href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/directory/template_dir_person.php3?indi=196">Allan Spale</a> as one of the recipients of the 2003 Chancellor&rsquo;s Student Service Award.<br><br>

The Chancellor&rsquo;s Student Service Awards was established in 1973 to honor students who have made outstanding contributions to the University through campus and community service. Student nominees must contribute a significant amount of time, effort, and creativity to one or more service projects during the academic year. In addition the students must be enrolled during the academic year in which the award is received, be in good academic standing, volunteered in a campus and/or community service organization and made significant contributions to that organization.
