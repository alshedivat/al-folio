YoungJoo Cho&rsquo;s PH.D. Dissertation - Submitted as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science in the Graduate College of the University of Illinois at Chicago, 2003.<br><br>

This dissertation describes a virtual world builder, called CLOVES (Construction of Layer Oriented Virtual Environment for Science inquiry learning). CLOVES focuses on enabling world designers to create data-rich virtual reality environments and simulated instruments for helping children&rsquo;s science inquiry learning.<br><br>

CLOVES serves as a medium for collaborative design among educators, programmers, and modelers by simplifying the collaborative design process model based on the articulation of hierarchical design responsibilities among potential world designers. CLOVES&rsquo; new design process model is also developed to increase the designers&rsquo; shared understanding of the construction process.<br><br>

A case study was conducted to evaluate CLOVES features and find out whether it works out as a collaborative medium. In addition to several improvements made to CLOVES, designers actually built a virtual world with the tool. The study also showed that the teacher participated in the study was able to establish the common ground - shared understanding - of the development process and actively participate in decision making at every stage of the development process.
