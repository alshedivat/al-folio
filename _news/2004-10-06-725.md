In today&rsquo;s world you are surrounded by an influx of images that suggest who you should be physically and mentally. Everyday whether you are watching T.V., a movie, or reading a magazine you are constantly being subjected to characters that you either identify with or don&rsquo;t.<br><br>

Tina Shah will present an analysis that deals with identity building through playing video games. The presentation will start with a brief overview of Jacques Lacan&rsquo;s mirror stage concept and a paper by Laura Mulvey that discusses the topic of image and self-image found in Hollywood cinema.<br><br>

The discussion will then lead to the influence that film has on video games and draw comparisons between the audience-film and player-game relationships and the role video games could potentially play in the identification process.
