Daniel J. Sandin is director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) and a professor in the School of Art and Design at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and an adjunct professor at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). His early interest in real-time computer graphics / video image processing and interactive computing environments motivated his pioneering work in video synthesizers and continues to influence his research interests.<br><br>

As co-director of EVL, Sandin also directs research in: virtual environments, digital libraries, scientific visualization, new methodologies for informal science and engineering education, paradigms for information display, tele-visualization (distributed graphics over networks), algorithm optimization for massively parallel computing, sonification, human / computer interfaces, and abstract mathematical visualization. He also is receiving recognition, along with EVL co-director Tom DeFanti, for conceiving the CAVE virtual reality theater in 1991.<br><br>

Sandin&rsquo;s computer / video art has been exhibited at conferences and museums worldwide, and he has received many awards. Sandin has received many grants and fellowships from such distinguished organizations as the Rockefeller Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts; and, his work is included in the inaugural collection of video art at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.<br><br>
