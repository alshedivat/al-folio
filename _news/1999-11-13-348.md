The Tele-Immersive Data Explorer (TIDE) is a CAVERNsoft-based collaborative, immersive environment for querying and visualizing data from massive and distributed data-stores. TIDE is designed as a re-usable framework to facilitate the construction of other domain-specific data exploration applications challenged with the problem of having to visualize massive data-sets.<br><br>

At Supercomputing &rsquo;99, TIDE clients running on ImmersaDesks at various research exhibits (notably the <a href="http://www.ncdm.uic.edu/">National Center for Data Mining</a>, <a href="http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/division/welcome/default.asp">Argonne National Laboratory</a>, <a href="http://access.ncsa.uiuc.edu/index.alliance.html">Alliance</a> and <a href="http://www.llnl.gov">ASCI</a> booths), collaboratively queried and correlated data distributed among several DSTP (Data Space Transfer Protocol) servers. DSTP is a next-generation data mining tool for the distribution, inquiry, and retrieval of data columns for correlation studies.
