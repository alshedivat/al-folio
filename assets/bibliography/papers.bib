  abstract={Event-based neuromorphic systems provide a low-power solution by using artificial neurons and synapses to process data asynchronously in the form of spikes. Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions (FTJs) are ultra low-power memory devices and are well-suited to be integrated in these systems. Here, we present a hybrid FTJ-CMOS Integrate-and-Fire neuron which constitutes a fundamental building block for new-generation neuromorphic networks for edge computing. We demonstrate electrically tunable neural dynamics achievable by tuning the switching of the FTJ device.},
