It demonstrates that this approach can improve system performance with minimal cost increase, validated through simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system."

These findings can guide responses to future socio-economic crises."

It shows that increased converter penetration speeds up disturbance propagation due to reduced system inertia, but fast active power control of converters can mitigate this effect, as demonstrated through simulations on various power system models."
