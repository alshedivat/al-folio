abstract = {AI clones are evolving to include digital representations of real world individuals as chatbots. While often used to replicate famous figures, as the technology becomes more accessible, it is crucial to understand whether everyday users would create their own clones and how they interact with them. In this study, within the scope of AI-generated personas and their role in representing users’ needs and identities, we focus on personas that directly reflect the qualities of real humans. We define this as AI self clones—conversational AI representations that reflect their human creators—and examine how creators construct and engage with them. We conducted a 7-day study in which participants (N=12) created and interacted with their text based AI self clones using CloneBuilder, a web-based authoring interface for configuring and tuning AI self clones. The system enables individuals to create AI representations that encapsulate their unique personality, values, and interaction style. Our findings reveal that each participant developed a clone tailored to their personal circumstances. As the participants iteratively refined and tested their clone, their direction and expectation of AI clones evolved from performing specific roles to evolving entities that facilitated self exploration and relationship formation. Unexpected responses from the clone prompted self reflection and identity questioning. Overall, this paper explores the motivations for creating these clones, the strategies participants use to build and refine them, and the moments of emotional connection and break out experiences that emerge during the crafting process, along with key design implications, challenges, and ethical considerations in developing AI self clones.}
